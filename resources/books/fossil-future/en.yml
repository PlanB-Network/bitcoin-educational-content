  In "Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas--Not Less," Alex Epstein challenges prevailing beliefs about the future of energy, arguing that the benefits of fossil fuels outweigh their side effects. Through a human flourishing framework, Epstein presents a compelling case for continued fossil fuel use, debunking misconceptions about climate impacts and renewable energy dominance. This thought-provoking book encourages readers to reevaluate their understanding of energy, the environment, and climate change, offering a new perspective on the path to global human flourishing.
