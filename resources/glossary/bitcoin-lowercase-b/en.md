Bitcoin (written with a lowercase "b") refers to the monetary unit used for exchanges on the electronic cash system Bitcoin (with an uppercase "B"). Bitcoin is often abbreviated as "BTC" or "XBT" and serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account within the network. Each bitcoin is divisible into 100 million smaller units, called "satoshis" or "sats," in honor of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins are issued through the process of proof of work (mining). The total number of bitcoins is limited to about 21 million.
