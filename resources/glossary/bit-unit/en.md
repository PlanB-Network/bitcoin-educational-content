term: BIT (UNIT)
---

In the context of Bitcoin, the term "bit" is also used to refer to a monetary subdivision of bitcoin. One bit is equal to 100 satoshis, which represent the smallest indivisible unit of bitcoin. Therefore, one bitcoin is equal to 1,000,000 bits or 100,000,000 satoshis. However, the use of this term as a monetary subdivision is subject to controversy. The majority of Bitcoin users employ either "sats" or "btc," but not "bit."
