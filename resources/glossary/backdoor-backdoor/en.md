term: BACKDOOR (BACKDOOR)
---

A backdoor is a secret mechanism that allows privileged access to a computer system, software, function, algorithm, or data, bypassing the usual authentication or security procedures. Unlike a security vulnerability, backdoors are intentionally introduced into the source code by malicious developers. They can be used to spy, manipulate, or steal sensitive information.

> ► *The term "porte dérobée" is not commonly used in French. The English translation "backdoor" is generally preferred.*
