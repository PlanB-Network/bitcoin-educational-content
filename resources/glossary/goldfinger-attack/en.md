term: GOLDFINGER (ATTACK)
---

Hypothetical scenario on the Bitcoin system where a malicious actor controls more than 50% of the total mining computational power (*hashrate*). With such dominance, the attacker can manipulate the consensus process, allowing for malicious actions such as double spending, where the same bitcoins are spent once on a chain that is eventually made obsolete, and then a second time on the valid chain. Another purpose of a Goldfinger attack is the censorship of transactions. However, carrying out such an attack requires considerable financial, human, energy, and technical resources, and makes the malicious actor susceptible to being discovered before the attack can take place. Although theoretically possible, a Goldfinger attack on Bitcoin is considered highly unlikely due to the decentralization of mining and the large amount of computational power currently deployed.
