term: ENTRY POINT
---

Information that allows linking an on-chain activity (an address, a transaction, a cluster...) to a form of identity belonging to a user or an entity. For example, if you post your receiving address on Twitter under your name, an analyst could find it and associate it with your identity. In this case, the tweet would constitute an entry point for chain analysis. To identify an entry point, analysts may use OSINT, but the most widespread method for associating on-chain activity with an identity remains KYC.
