PlanB's mission is to provide top-tier educational resources on Bitcoin, in as many languages as possible. All content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, which allows anyone to participate in enriching the platform. Contributions can take various forms: correcting and proofreading existing texts, translating into other languages, updating information, or creating new tutorials not yet available on our site.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to easily contribute to the translation of our site. The data on our site is divided into two main categories:
- the frontend data (pages, buttons, etc.);
- and the educational content (tutorials, courses, resources...).

For the translation of educational content, we use [an approach that combines human work and translations with artificial intelligences](https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator). If you detect errors in these contents and wish to correct them, I invite you to consult our tutorial dedicated to correcting educational content.

However, if you are interested in translating other sections of the site, excluding educational content, you are in the right place! To effectively translate the frontend, we use the Weblate tool, which facilitates collaboration and organizes translations. It is a very simple tool to get started with. Let's go through, step by step, how to use Weblate.

If you wish to add a completely new language to PlanB Network that is not yet available on Weblate, you will first need to submit a request for addition. For this, follow this specific tutorial.

## Starting a Translation Session

- Click on the `Website Frontend Element` project:
![weblate](assets/08.webp)
- You will then arrive at an interface with all the languages for which the site translation has been started:
![weblate](assets/09.webp)
- Choose your language. For example, I will take French:
![weblate](assets/10.webp)
- To start translating, simply click on the `Translate` button:
![weblate](assets/11.webp)
- You will then arrive at the work interface:
![weblate](assets/12.webp)
- Weblate will then automatically suggest sentences, paragraphs, or even buttons to translate into the `English` box:
![weblate](assets/13.webp)
- Your task then consists of proposing a translation for the indicated text. You must enter your translation in the box corresponding to the language you have chosen. For example, if you are working on the French version, write your translation in the `French` box:
![weblate](assets/14.webp)
- Click on the `Automatic suggestion` tab:
![weblate](assets/15.webp)
- Here, Weblate offers you a translation for each paragraph made with artificial intelligence:
![weblate](assets/16.webp)
- If the suggested translation seems relevant to you, you can click on the `Clone to translation` button:
![weblate](assets/17.webp)
- The suggestion is now placed in your work box:
![weblate](assets/18.webp)
- You can then manually modify the suggestion:
![weblate](assets/19.webp)
- Once the translation seems satisfactory to you, click on the `Save and Continue` button:
![weblate](assets/20.webp)
- And there you go! Your translation has been successfully saved. Weblate will automatically redirect you to the next item to translate:
![weblate](assets/21.webp)
- By returning to the dashboard corresponding to your language, you can see that there are different statuses for the items to be translated. By clicking on `Translate`, you can work directly on the items of a specific status:
