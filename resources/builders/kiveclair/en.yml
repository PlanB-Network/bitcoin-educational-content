   Kiveclair was born in May 2021, in response to the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, with the initial goal of providing direct aid to the disaster victims.
   Based in Goma, the initiative quickly transformed into an organization dedicated to educating the local population about Bitcoin. Kiveclair organizes monthly meetings and in-depth training for various audiences, including activists, energy producers, and journalists. Additionally, the association hosts an annual conference, bringing together the Congolese Bitcoin ecosystem to promote exchanges and the development of practical applications.
