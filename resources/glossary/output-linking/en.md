term: OUTPUT LINKING
---

Sometimes used synonymously to refer to address reuse. Output linking refers to the practice of using the same receiving address to lock multiple UTXOs, sometimes across several different transactions. Bitcoins are typically locked using a cryptographic key pair that corresponds to a unique address. Since the blockchain is public, it is easy to see which addresses are associated with how many bitcoins. In the case of reusing the same address for multiple payments, it can be assumed that all the associated UTXOs belong to the same entity. Therefore, address reuse poses a problem for the user's privacy. It allows for deterministic links between multiple transactions and UTXOs, as well as perpetuating on-chain fund tracking.
