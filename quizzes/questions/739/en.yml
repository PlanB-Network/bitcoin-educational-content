question: How can Bitcoin miners help in managing energy surpluses and stabilizing power grids?
answer: Bitcoin miners can absorb energy surpluses, acting as a flexible buffer, adjusting demand rather than supply. In a world where electricity production from renewable (non-controllable) sources is constantly increasing, miners can play a key role in ensuring the balance of our power grids, while benefiting from cheap or surplus electricity to power their mining operations.
wrong_answers:
  - Bitcoin miners can help in managing energy surpluses by storing the excess energy in batteries.
  - Bitcoin miners can help in managing energy surpluses by selling the excess energy back to the grid.
  - Bitcoin miners can help in managing energy surpluses by converting the excess energy into heat.
