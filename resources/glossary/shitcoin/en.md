term: SHITCOIN
---

A derogatory term frequently used in the cryptocurrency world to describe altcoins considered to be worthless or without a future. This term is used in two distinct contexts: in the general cryptocurrency environment, it refers to a project that lacks technological innovation, does not present a concrete use case, or is primarily the result of excessive speculation. For Bitcoin maximalists, the term encompasses all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC), thus making "shitcoin" synonymous with "altcoin." The word is a combination of "shit," which means the same in English, and "coin." The initial use of the term dates back to a message posted by the user Ribuck on November 8, 2010, on the Bitcoin Talk forum.
