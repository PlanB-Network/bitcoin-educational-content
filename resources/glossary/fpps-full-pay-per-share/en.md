term: FPPS (FULL PAY PER SHARE)
---

Method for calculating miners' compensation within mining pools. It is an evolution of the PPS (*Pay Per Share*) method. It compensates miners not only for each valid share they submit but also includes a portion of block rewards. The compensation is calculated based on the average of previous transactions and the pool's hashrate. Thus, miners receive a reward for the shares submitted, whether a block is found or not, but this method also compensates for the expected value. It offers a stable and predictable compensation for miners, as it eliminates the variance associated with the probability of finding a block, while exposing them to market fee fluctuations. However, it is riskier for pool operators, as they must pay miners even when no block is found, thereby absorbing the variance risk.
