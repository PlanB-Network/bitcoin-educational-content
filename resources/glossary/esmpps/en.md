term: ESMPPS
---

Acronym for "*Equalized Shared Maximum Pay Per Share*". It is a method for calculating the remuneration of miners within mining pools. ESMPPS aims to distribute rewards equitably among all submitted shares, regardless of the timing of their submission or the pool's luck. It essentially functions like SMPPS, but with an added notion of equality for the submitted shares.
