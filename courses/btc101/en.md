## A Leap into the Unknown
<chapterId>27e3fb60-4b50-556b-9e70-c4f5475c121d</chapterId>

### Welcome to a new monetary and technological paradigm.

Bitcoin is a significant innovation that goes beyond a simple "internet currency". It is a revolution both in technology and in money, capable of questioning our relationship with currency and society. Bitcoin is a so-called **neutral** and **decentralized** currency, which means that it is not controlled by any entity or institution. It is a significant innovation that goes beyond a mere currency. In order to understand this famous bitcoin, it is important to understand that bitcoin (referred to as BTC) is both a computer protocol (Bitcoin) and a monetary unit (bitcoin).

The protocol uses underlying technologies such as cryptography, network communication, and the famous "blockchain", while the bitcoin unit is the currency necessary for the proper functioning of this same protocol. In everyday life, Salvadorans or bitcoiners around the world use bitcoin currency to buy and sell goods and services, with the currency relying on the Bitcoin protocol to function.

### A comprehensive yet accessible curriculum

In this course, we will discuss the monetary aspects of Bitcoin, including how to buy and sell bitcoins, securely store them in digital wallets, and use them for transactions. We will also examine the role of miners, who are essential for creating new bitcoins and securing the Bitcoin network. Additionally, we will explore the future of Bitcoin and how the Lightning Network technology can improve Bitcoin transactions.

Before discussing the definition and functioning of money in society (Chapter 1), we start with the genesis of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a relatively new technology, launched in 2009, that is unlike anything else. It is therefore normal not to understand everything at once. In fact, just like when learning to use the Internet or a car, you don't need to know all the technical details to use Bitcoin (receive, pay, secure your funds).

The importance here is mainly to understand this new technology in a general way. We hope that this training will please you and provide you with the necessary foundation to understand and perhaps continue to progress in this new global monetary paradigm.

## The Prehistory of Bitcoin
<chapterId>9a94b627-5b69-5d81-9125-f1fa9b0aa6ad</chapterId>

Before the term "Bitcoin" became synonymous with digital currency and financial transformation, a series of ideas, innovations, and social movements laid the groundwork for its creation. One of the fundamental elements of this prehistory of Bitcoin is the cypherpunk movement.

### Cypherpunks: Visionaries of the Digital World

![image](assets/en/chapter0/0.webp)
In the heart of the technological evolution of the 1980s and 1990s, a group of people began to deeply question the role of privacy and freedom in the digital age. These individuals, who would later become known as "cypherpunks," firmly believed that cryptography could serve as a tool to protect individual rights against interference from governments and large corporations.

Iconic figures such as Julian Assange, Wei Dai, Tim May, and David Chaum contributed to defining the philosophy and vision of cypherpunks. These thinkers shared their ideas in an influential mailing list, where participants from around the world debated the best way to use technology to ensure greater individual freedom.

### The Three Pillar Texts of Cypherpunks

![image](assets/en/chapter0/2.webp)

The cypherpunk movement, with its deep roots in digital activism and cryptography, relied on several fundamental texts to express its principles and vision of the future. Among these writings, three stand out in particular:

- The "Cypherpunk Manifesto":
  Written by Eric Hughes in 1993, the "Cypherpunk Manifesto" asserts that privacy is a fundamental right. Hughes argued that the ability to communicate freely and confidentially was essential for a free society. The manifesto states, "We cannot expect institutions, corporations, or other impersonal entities to grant us privacy... We must defend it ourselves."

- The "Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto":
  Written by Timothy C. May in 1992, this manifesto explains how the use of cryptography could lead to an era of cryptographic anarchy where governments would be powerless to interfere in the private affairs of citizens. May envisioned a future where information, money, and messages could be exchanged without the intervention of a third party, and anonymously.

- The "Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace":
  Although not exclusively cypherpunk, this text reflects the sentiments of many actors in the movement. Written in 1996 by John Perry Barlow, it is a response to the increasing regulation of the Internet by governments. The declaration asserts that cyberspace is a distinct realm from the physical sphere and should not be subject to the same laws. It states, "We have no elected government, and we cannot be governed."

### Predecessors of Bitcoin

Before the emergence of Bitcoin, several attempts had been made to create a digital currency. For example, David Chaum introduced the concept of "anonymous electronic money" with his project "DigiCash" in the 1980s. Unfortunately, due to various constraints, DigiCash never really took off.

Another important precursor is Wei Dai's "b-money". Although it was never implemented, it presented the idea of an anonymous digital currency where fraud detection was performed by a community of evaluators rather than a central authority.

![image](assets/en/chapter0/1.webp)

It was in this fertile environment that the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008. He combined several ideas from the cypherpunk movement, such as proof of work and cryptographic timestamps, to create a decentralized and censorship-resistant digital currency.

Bitcoin was more than just a digital currency; it represented an achievement of cypherpunk ideals. Beyond its technology, it symbolized a revolution against traditional financial systems and offered an alternative based on transparency, decentralization, and individual sovereignty.

### Conclusion

The prehistory of Bitcoin is deeply rooted in the cypherpunk movement and a collective quest for greater freedom in the digital age. By combining the principles of cryptography, decentralization, and integrity, Bitcoin has become much more than a currency; it is the product of a philosophical and technological revolution that continues to reshape our world.

Therefore, Bitcoin is a protocol that spans long periods of time and encourages us to question our relationship with energy, time, and money. But is Bitcoin a "real" currency? What is money? Does it exist in multiple forms? We will explore these questions in the next chapter.

# Money
<partId>e913df1a-4cbd-5380-ba67-ca2a0414f671</partId>

## Money Throughout History
<chapterId>c838e64d-d59f-5703-8c74-ea5e8c4fdd31</chapterId>

The evolution of money is a fascinating aspect of human history, reflecting the ingenuity of civilizations throughout the ages in meeting constantly evolving economic needs.

![image](assets/en/chapter1/2.webp)

### From Shells to Bank Accounts'

'Originally, currency was tangible, often linked to essential goods such as grain, livestock, and other commodities. However, these goods had major drawbacks, such as perishability, making it difficult to use them as a long-term savings medium. For example, a failed harvest or illness could wipe out an individual's wealth overnight.
As civilizations advanced and trade expanded to new regions, there was a need for a universal medium of exchange. Objects such as shells and gemstones were experimented with, but they were not perfect. Gold eventually became the standard due to its rarity, durability, and divisibility. It was, and remains to this day, a symbol of wealth and power.

![image](assets/en/chapter1/1.webp)

### What is the role of money?

Money is a highly sophisticated communication tool:

- It allows communication between the present and the future. We transform our time and energy into an asset that can be reused in the future without the risk of devaluation.

- It allows communication in a universal common language. Without knowing each other, without speaking the same language, two strangers can exchange, trade, and agree on the value of things.

Its function in our world is difficult to artificially replicate. No human or group of humans can create money; it is a natural social phenomenon that must emerge from the market and voluntary consensus. Prices are signals, information, that help society choose how resources will be allocated.

Gold as money is the choice of 4,000 years of monetary Darwinism based on 3 functions:

- Store of value
- Medium of exchange
- Unit of account

![image](assets/en/chapter1/3.webp)
![image](assets/en/chapter1/4.webp)
![image](assets/en/chapter1/5.webp)

### The characteristics of money

Gold ideally meets the criteria of an efficient currency: its natural rarity makes it valuable, while its chemical properties allow it to not erode over time. However, this form of money is not easily divisible or transportable over long distances. In a globalized and digital world, gold cannot keep up and needs a central entity to make it divisible and easily exchangeable (minted coin).

These flaws have made gold a store of value, but not a common currency, to the detriment of state fiduciary currencies (fiat) that are easily usable but constantly devalued by the entities that control them (king, central bank, emperor, dictator).

The criteria for an effective currency are multiple. A good currency must be:

![image](assets/en/chapter1/6.webp)

- **Fungible**, meaning interchangeable without loss of value
- **Divisible**, in order to facilitate transactions of different volumes
- **Liquid**, meaning easily convertible into goods or services.

In order to meet these criteria, currency evolves step by step:

- Raw stone -> Coin
- Banknote -> Bank card
- Blockchain -> Lightning Network

Today, currencies are still evolving, adapting their forms to meet different uses. For example, while gold is an excellent store of value, it is no longer suitable for the current globalized economy. Similarly, fiduciary currencies such as the dollar and the euro are very liquid and easily transportable because they are now mostly digital, however their value is constantly eroded by monetary inflation.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, presents new possibilities. Due to its properties, such as its strictly limited supply, it offers an excellent store of value. Moreover, as a neutral internet currency, it represents a good means of exchange that knows no borders. However, it is still not widely accepted in commerce today, despite [constant adoption](https://btcmap.org/map).

### Quick recap in a poster!

## Fiduciary currencies
<chapterId>25151d46-7db1-5b48-8bba-cbde1944555a</chapterId>

"Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat the same mistakes," said George Santayana. A truth that resonates particularly when it comes to the current monetary system.

### Fiduciary = trust

Today, major currencies such as the euro and the dollar are considered fiduciary. This means that they have no intrinsic value. Their value relies entirely on the trust and belief we place in the institutions that regulate them.

'A fiduciary currency is a form of currency that is decreed as currency by an institution, such as a nation-state, like China with the Yen, or a politico-economic union, such as the European Union with the Euro. The entity in charge of issuing fiduciary currency is a central bank (For example, we can mention the People's Bank of China, the Federal Reserve of the United States, or the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea). It is these entities that are in charge of deciding monetary policy and therefore how much money should be put into circulation or printed.

![image](assets/en/chapter2/1.webp)

### Monetary devaluation: A strategy as old as the Roman Empire

Since antiquity, gold has served as a monetary reference. However, its rigidity has often led leaders - whether Roman emperors or modern governments - to adopt alternative currencies, often fiduciary.

The mechanism is simple and inspired by practices that have existed since the origins of civilization. Leaders, eager to exert control over wealth, begin by centralizing gold, often by exploiting their power and promising protection and security. With this precious reserve in their hands, they introduce a new currency, equivalent in value to gold, but minted in their effigy. This currency then begins to circulate, and the people quickly become accustomed to its convenience.

Gradually, these leaders discreetly devalue the new currency, reducing its value compared to the initial gold by a few percent each year. This silent devaluation is often justified as being in the interest of the people. Thus, those who save in this fiduciary currency see the value of their savings erode, while the state finances its projects through inflation. Furthermore, this devaluation makes debt easier to repay.

![image](assets/en/chapter2/3.webp)

At a critical moment, the announcement is made: the currency is no longer backed by gold. The public, now accustomed to fiduciary currency and often misinformed about financial matters, accepts this reality. The state then has free rein to manipulate the money supply, printing enormous sums of money at almost no cost.

This strategy, when well executed, can last for decades. However, a too rapid devaluation or loss of confidence can lead to hyperinflation (see next chapter). History shows that the dollar has lost 98% of its value in 100 years, the euro 30% in 20 years, and the pound sterling 99% since its creation.

In the end, the currency may no longer have any connection to gold, reminiscent of Roman coins at the end of the Empire, or even be reduced to a simple numerical value, disconnected from tangible reality.

Today, we are witnessing a historic turning point. The dollar, which has long dominated, seems to be in decline, and gold has lost its central place. We are at the hinge of a new monetary cycle, reminding us that lessons from history are often forgotten.

![image](assets/en/chapter2/4.webp)

### Is Bitcoin a solution?

It is in this context that the Bitcoin revolution is gaining momentum. This currency, which requires **no trusted third party**, aims to separate the State from money.

Monetary printing leads to inflation, gradually impoverishing the population. On the other hand, financial institutions and wealthy individuals have benefited from this practice, creating a gap of inequalities and favoring authoritarianism. The current financial system is regulated and restricted to avoid its collapse, and any disruption could provoke a major economic crisis. As political actors benefit from this system, they are not incentivized to make radical changes, allowing the system to continue its course until a possible implosion.

![image](assets/en/chapter2/2.webp)

In response to these systemic challenges, Bitcoin presents itself as a decentralized solution: a new parallel monetary system. Historically, gold has been favored as a currency due to its resistance to counterfeiting. Similarly, Bitcoin, through its decentralized and cryptographic nature, cannot be falsified and is limited to 21 million units. Bitcoin is a currency that relies on transparency and neutrality, offering an attractive alternative to the current centralized monetary system.

![image](assets/en/chapter2/0.webp)

At the same time, the emergence of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, seems inevitable. This new form of currency would offer a more centrally planned economy, which could hinder individuals' financial freedom and facilitate authoritarian abuses.
We can conclude this chapter with the quote from Nobel Prize winner F.A Hayek in 1984: "I do not believe that we will ever find a good currency until we take it out of the hands of the government. However, we cannot violently take it from them; all we can do is introduce something they cannot stop through clever trickery."

## Hyperinflation
<chapterId>b04c024c-54f3-50cb-997f-58721cfc74be</chapterId>

Hyperinflation is a monetary phenomenon specific to fiat currencies. It is characterized by a complete loss of confidence in a currency and a drastic increase in inflation through monetary printing by authorities. As a result, the savings accumulated by individuals can dissipate in a relatively short period of time, pushing the country to the brink of economic, social, and political collapse.

### Inflation Running Wild!

Let's try to understand the impact of inflation on savings by considering different inflation rates.

- With 2% inflation, you lose 2% of your purchasing power annually, which amounts to 10% over 5 years.
- With 7%, you lose half of it in 10 years.
- With 20%, you lose almost half of it in 3 years.

During hyperinflation, we are no longer talking about 20% per year, but rather 20% per month or, at its peak, per DAY. 100% inflation per day over 3 days is a realistic scenario that has happened and continues to happen in our world.

It is important to understand that hyperinflation does not happen by magic, by chance, by capitalism, or by political opponents. Hyperinflation is the direct consequence of false monetary decisions made by central bankers and politicians. Its consequences affect all citizens and will impact generations. I invite you to spend 5 minutes studying this table to fully realize the real impact of this phenomenon (the ECON204 course will go into detail on this subject)."

![image](assets/en/chapter3/1.webp)

### How Does Hyperinflation Occur?

![image](assets/en/chapter3/3.webp)

Phase 1 - Loss of Confidence

- Centralization of monetary power facilitates the creation of money and its abuses. A loss of confidence in a currency can then emerge and trigger hyperinflation. Individuals then begin to question the origin of money and the benefits of mandated monetary policy. This loss of confidence is generally due to external factors such as wars, social measures, or the rise in prices of a key resource, such as wheat or gasoline.

Phase 2 - Currency collapse & price increase

- As governments lose control of trust, individuals begin to exchange their currency for another, more stable one, such as the US dollar in Venezuela. This leads to a rise in prices, creating a vicious circle where goods and services become increasingly expensive. To meet these needs, the state prints more money to correct monetary policy, resulting in exponential inflation.

Phase 3 - The vicious circle of money printing

- More and more bills are needed to buy goods, creating a scarcity of paper money. This leads to more bill printing, creating even more inflation.

![image](assets/en/chapter3/4.webp)

Phase 4 - A new currency emerges

- A new currency is then introduced to replace the old one. A notable example of hyperinflation is Germany in the years 1920-1924. To revive the economy, a new currency was created, backed by German, French, and English debt, and guaranteed by German lands.

Resolving a hyperinflation crisis often requires radical changes, such as revolutions, changes in government, changes in central bankers, among others. Loss of confidence, currency collapse, and reconstruction are essential phases to revive a new economy based on fiat currency.

### 3 notable examples

- Germany, 1922-1923

  One of the most striking examples of hyperinflation occurred in the German Weimar Republic after World War I.

  Germany had borrowed enormous amounts of money to finance the war effort, and not only did Germany not win the war, but it had to pay billions of dollars in reparations. The month with the highest inflation was October 1923, peaking at 29,500%, or an inflation rate of 20.9% per day. Prices doubled every 3.7 days!
  It is said that in restaurants, waiters had to announce the menu prices every 30 minutes to account for inflation. The German currency became so useless that some citizens preferred to burn their paper money rather than wood because it was actually cheaper.

  ![image](assets/en/chapter3/5.webp)

- Hungary, 1945-1946

  The country that experienced the worst period of hyperinflation in history to date is by far Hungary after World War II.

  Hungary found itself on the losing side of the conflict and the war had destroyed most of its industrial production capacity. The month with the highest inflation was July 1946, with a price inflation of 41,900,000,000,000,000%, equivalent to 207% per day. Prices doubled every 15 hours!

  The last banknote to be put into circulation was a 100 million billion pengo (100,000,000,000,000,000) banknote in 1946.

![image](assets/en/chapter3/6.webp)

- Zimbabwe, 2007-2008
  Until the year 2000, Zimbabwe was self-sufficient for almost all its needs except for oil.

  In 1997, the Zimbabwean dollar collapsed by over 72% after the government agreed to compensate war veterans for an amount equivalent to 450 million US dollars. Since the government did not have such an amount in its coffers, it had to resort to running the printing press. In 2005, inflation reached 586% and in March 2007, monthly inflation reached 50%.

  In June 2007, the government reacted by imposing price controls. Stores were literally "looted". Merchants now no longer have the means to restock their shops.

  In April 2009, the Minister of Finance announced the suspension of the Zimbabwean dollar and authorized the use of different foreign currencies for trade. All bank accounts, pensions, and financial institutions saw their balances evaporate overnight.

![image](assets/en/chapter3/7.webp)

In conclusion, hyperinflation has the effect of rapidly degrading the value of the currency, leading to erosion of savings and loss of confidence in the monetary system. As Voltaire once suggested, a fiat currency will always eventually lose its intrinsic value and converge towards zero.
'A currency that relies on a trusted third party like a financial institution is, in practice and in the long term, a defective currency because it is unable to guarantee purchasing power or preserve savings.

## 21 million bitcoins
<chapterId>f4a06d76-1963-56fd-93ff-dfa41489bcde</chapterId>

### Bitcoin's Monetary Policy

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency with a pre-defined maximum quantity of **21 million units**. This intrinsic characteristic of scarcity is determined by its computer code and reinforced by the consensus of all users participating in the protocol.

![image](assets/en/chapter4/0.webp)

Regarding its monetary issuance, it can be illustrated by an S-curve that represents the quantity of bitcoins created over time. For example, in 2022, approximately 18.5 million bitcoins were in circulation. Forecasts indicate that by 2025, there will be around 19.5 million bitcoins, representing ~93% of the total supply, and by 2037, this figure will reach 20.4 million.

### How to Create New Bitcoins?

The creation of new bitcoins is the result of the mining process, a procedure for verifying transactions on the Bitcoin network.

![image](assets/en/chapter4/1.webp)

Miners, who perform this task, are rewarded with the issuance of new bitcoins every ten minutes. This reward is programmed to halve every 210,000 blocks, which is approximately every four years, an event known as "halving" -- giving the monetary issuance curve a stair-like shape. Due to this halving mechanism, it can be mathematically predicted that the creation of bitcoins will cease in 2140, when the total number of bitcoins reaches its limit of 21 million.

| Halving Number | Block Height | BTC Reward After Halving  | Estimated BTC in Circulation After Halving |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1              | 210,000      | 25 BTC                    | 10,500,000 BTC                             |

We'll come back to miners in detail in the mining chapter.

### Guaranteeing digital scarcity

Bitcoin's scarcity is guaranteed by two key mechanisms: the adjustment of mining difficulty and game theory:

- Mining difficulty adjustment is a mechanism that takes place every 2016 blocks, or around two weeks, to ensure that, on average, a new block is added to the blockchain every ten minutes. This frequency of block creation and the total quantity of bitcoins are fixed aspects of the Bitcoin protocol and cannot be changed without a general consensus, unlike the arbitrary decisions made in traditional monetary systems.

![image](assets/en/chapter4/2.webp)

> Did you know? Miners are incentivized to mine a block to earn the new bitcoins (block subsidy) and transaction fees associated with the transactions they include in their block. As the number of bitcoins issued approaches the 21 million limit, miners will be remunerated more through their transaction fees than through the block subsidy.'

- Game theory is a mathematical concept that relies on human rationality. Here, in Bitcoin, it is the users who vote for protocol changes. Yes, you read that right: any modification to the Bitcoin protocol would require the agreement of the entire community of users, which is highly complex. So, if someone wanted to create a 22nd million bitcoin, they would have to convince all users to voluntarily devalue their own savings, which is unlikely to happen because Bitcoin is global and not governed by a central group.

![image](assets/en/chapter4/3.webp)

The idea of devaluing the currency goes against the fundamental philosophy of Bitcoin, so changing this limit is highly unlikely.

### An auditable monetary policy every second from the beginning and forever!

The scarcity of Bitcoin is a major asset, and the maximum quantity of 21 million bitcoins in circulation is public and verifiable by anyone.

In fact, anyone can verify the quantity of bitcoins in circulation by entering a simple command on a Bitcoin node: `bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo`. This transparency and verifiability strengthen trust in the Bitcoin system, which is not based on centralized institutions or individuals, but on a mathematical and cryptographic guarantee inherent in its protocol. (You will learn how to do this easily in LN201)

```json
{
  "height": 710560,
  "bestblock": "0000000000000000000887384d67103412ea7f18a43953e65c8c4ac36bf42e54",
  "transactions": 473244,
  "txouts": 1018917,
  "bogosize": 2183872374,
  "hash_serialized_2": "eebb9987337700ffaacbbaa11223344",
  "disk_size": 178239584,
  "total_amount": 18745998.12345678
}
```

Bitcoin, by its design, guarantees sound monetary management by limiting its creation and protecting users' savings, distinguishing it from other currencies. Aligned with the principles of Austrian economics (details in ECON201), its controlled quantity and predictable distribution protect it from the inherent risks of inflation in traditional currencies.

In summary, Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, programmed scarcity, and transparency, offers a unique alternative to traditional monetary systems. It illustrates how technology can be used to create a currency that is not only useful and verifiable but also preserves the value of users' savings by strictly limiting its supply.

### Conclusion of section 1!

# Wallets Bitcoin
<partId>28860585-4f61-59d9-b242-f4c57d837cc1</partId>

## What are Bitcoin wallets?
<chapterId>1c0166ab-cb7a-5bc6-9175-d13482bd91f1</chapterId>

In this section 2, we will explore the storage and security of Bitcoins within wallets. This will allow you to better understand where these famous bitcoins are located and how to interact with them!

### Demystifying Bitcoin wallets

In this industry, we use wallets to interact with the Bitcoin network, which has 3 functions:

- Allow receiving bitcoins
- Allow sending bitcoins
- Secure them against hacking and theft attempts

A wallet can be software on your computer, an application on your smartphone, a physical device like a USB key, or even a piece of paper. These different types of Bitcoin wallets each serve different use cases. Some are used for large amounts with an emphasis on security, others for privacy, or even for daily payment of small amounts.

Portfolios are therefore divided into large families of use, always with a central question: Are you the owner of the funds or do you leave control of your money to a third party? We will come back to this topic in detail in the next chapter, but the idea is simple: Is the money in your pocket or in your banker's pocket!

![image](assets/en/chapter5/3.webp)

### How does a Bitcoin wallet work

Whether it's your Bitcoin "banker" or yourself, in general, the vast majority of Bitcoin wallets work with similar technology, that of asymmetric cryptography, and therefore a system of key pairs: a private key to spend and a public key to receive.

- Private key
  When initializing a wallet, a secret recovery phrase (private key) is generated and given to you in the form of 24 words.

  The private key is very important because it represents ownership of the bitcoins and therefore the right to use or send them. The holder of the private key is the owner of the Bitcoins.

  This key must be kept secret and well preserved, as it is the key that unlocks your fortune!

- Public key & address
  The public key is created with the private key and therefore linked to it. The public key is used to generate Bitcoin addresses and thus receive money. Sharing the public key involves risks to privacy, but not to security.

  These addresses are created by your wallet and can be shared securely. It is advisable to use them only once to maximize your privacy.

It is therefore important to understand that thanks to this technology, we can easily receive Bitcoins without allowing the sender to steal our funds! Think of it like a mailbox: people deposit money in it, but you are the only one who can open it.

![image](assets/en/chapter5/4.webp)

### Are the Bitcoins in the wallet then?

Although your keys are stored in your wallet, the bitcoins themselves are actually "stored" in the Bitcoin blockchain, which is a public distributed ledger within the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network (we will look at this in section 3). That is why losing the device on which you have your wallet does not necessarily mean the loss of your bitcoins. What allows you to recreate your wallet and spend your bitcoin is the private key. It is therefore crucial to secure it properly.

![image](assets/en/chapter5/1.webp)

Fortunately for us, since 2017, this private key can be encoded in a simple list of 12 or 24 words, called the mnemonic phrase. This phrase is a backup of your Bitcoin wallet, it is what allows you to recreate your wallet with any Bitcoin wallet software/app. Therefore, anyone who has access to this list of words has access to your bitcoins.

### What about hackers?

One might ask: what if someone accidentally guesses our list of 12 or 24 words? The short answer is that thanks to the cryptography used to create the wallet, it is highly unlikely. To put it into perspective, accidentally finding access to your wallet is like finding the "right" number between 1 and $2^256$, which is almost equivalent to finding the "right" atom in the Universe. However, if you are not satisfied with this default security, you can always strengthen it by adding a passphrase to your Bitcoin wallet.

![image](assets/en/chapter5/5.webp)

Thus, the probability of hacking your Bitcoin wallet is astronomically low if you follow good security practices. Practices that we detail in the next section.

Choose a wallet that suits your needs and usage. Detailed tutorials on the use and securing of different wallets are available in the [tutorial section of our university](https://planb.network/tutorials/wallet).

## Security and Bitcoin Wallets
<chapterId>00c1afea-e54a-511f-bab3-2efc2fbfa6a1</chapterId>

### Asking the right questions before starting

When you own bitcoins, the security of your funds is a major concern. The best way to define security that is suitable for your situation is to ask (and answer) a series of questions; your security model will depend on your answers. Let's start:

- Who can access my funds? In other words, are you the only one who has access to your bitcoins, or does a third party, such as a company, allow you to access your funds?
- A second question could be: what are the uses you plan to have with your bitcoins? Is it a sum that you use regularly? Is it medium-term savings? Long-term savings?
- What are your technical skills?
- What is your security budget?

Keep in mind that there is no universal solution. So take the time to answer these questions, as it will help tailor your security measures.

![image](assets/en/chapter6/0.webp)

### Thinking about Bitcoin wallets in terms of complexity

Let's try to establish several levels of security for your bitcoins:

- **Level 0**, you use a so-called custodial service where you are not the sole holder of your bitcoins. Be aware that this trusted third party can restrict your access to your funds at any time, and you have the same level of financial sovereignty as with the traditional banking system through a bank account.

![image](assets/en/chapter6/2.webp)

- **Level 1**, you use a Bitcoin wallet on your phone or computer where you are the sole holder of your bitcoins. You can easily carry out your transactions. However, it is crucial to backup the mnemonic phrase to regain access to your funds in case of loss of your phone or computer. It is often referred to as a "hot wallet" because the private key is stored on a device with internet access.

- **Level 2**, you use a physical wallet, and you have secured your list of 12 or 24 words. To perform a transaction, you will always need to sign with your device. This makes your funds less accessible on a daily basis. It is often referred to as a "Cold Wallet" because your keys are stored on a device that is not connected to the internet.

![image](assets/en/chapter6/4.webp)

- **Level 3**, you use a level 1 or 2 wallet but with an additional passphrase. Be aware that you now need to backup both the list of 12 or 24 words **and** your passphrase. Ideally, these two pieces of information are stored in two different places.

![image](assets/en/chapter6/5.webp)

- **Level 4**, you use a set of wallets to create a "multisig" wallet, which means it requires multiple signatures to perform a transaction. Be aware that each part of the multisig should be stored in different locations. This is often considered an advanced use of Bitcoin, mainly used for large amounts and corporate use.

![image](assets/en/chapter6/3.webp)

Of course, we can have multiple use cases, and in such cases, it is recommended to use multiple Bitcoin wallets. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.

### Security must adapt

The amount one is willing to leave on a specific security level depends on each individual. For some, leaving 1 BTC on a hot wallet is reasonable, while for others, it is absolutely not. In any case, avoid spending a lot on security by buying a physical wallet when you want to secure a small amount. Also, keep in mind that overcomplicating the security and accessibility of your bitcoins can harm you if, for example, you mishandle the backups of your wallets.

In conclusion, direct ownership of one's bitcoins is an essential element to ensure financial sovereignty. It is recommended to use a mobile wallet for daily expenses and an offline, or "cold," physical wallet to store larger amounts. Businesses, on the other hand, should consider using multi-signature systems, or "multisig," for increased and shared security. It is also essential to avoid custodial services, which can replicate some vulnerabilities of the traditional financial system as much as possible.

Now that we have this in mind, let's move on to the next section to see the steps to create a Bitcoin wallet. However, if you wish to further explore the topic of security, you can read this [article by DarthCoin](https://asi0.substack.com/p/bitcoin-soyez-votre-propre-banque).

### Quick recap in a poster!

## Setting up a wallet
<chapterId>615519eb-4565-557d-86a0-021badf7616f</chapterId>

The security of your bitcoins is of crucial importance, and a simple mistake can have costly consequences. That's why we will now look at the best practices when creating a new Bitcoin wallet.

> Note that the BTC102 course will guide you through this step.

### This step is no joke!

Your private key, often represented by a list of 24 words (often called a "seed" or "mnemonic phrase"), represents access to your funds. If this key is revealed to a third party, consider the associated funds no longer secure. Therefore, when initializing your wallet, it is important to follow these rules:

- Cover all cameras.
- Do not take a photo of the word list.
- Do not enter it on a computer or phone.
- Do not save it as a contact or send it to yourself via SMS.
- Never leave your words unattended on your desk.
- Never hide your word list in an unusual place.

You will literally take a blank sheet of paper or print this [template](https://bitcoiner.guide/backup.pdf), and write the word list in order, neatly and clearly, with a pen. If the ink fades over time, you may lose your funds; therefore, it is important to keep this paper protected from the elements.

![image](assets/en/chapter7/0.webp)

### Tips for doing it right

There are also alternative solutions to paper, such as engraving your mnemonic phrase on a metal plate. If you write it incorrectly, your heirs may not be able to read it and therefore may not be able to recover the funds. Once the words are written, it is recommended to make a second copy and store it in a separate location from the first. This provides a backup in case of loss or accident with the first copy.

![image](assets/en/chapter7/1.webp)

Once the copies are made, store the word lists in a safe place where you will remember to look for them! Do not create a too complex hiding plan where you risk losing them.

> Your words = your money.

"Cold" wallets generally have these word lists, just like "hot" wallets on mobile or PC. This method of backing up the private key is now the standard. This means that you can enter your mnemonic phrase into any wallet software to restore yours. Only bad wallets that we strongly discourage will not give you a list of 24 words, but may ask for an account, an email address, or worse, an ID.

**ATTENTION: The absence of a list of 24 words should alert you.**

## Standing the test of time
<chapterId>f58cd446-c202-5eff-aab7-e61cc40e5c06</chapterId>

Security is a major concern in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Indeed, like any form of wealth, your bitcoins must be protected against loss, theft, and degradation, especially in the long term. Securing your bitcoins requires some technical knowledge and awareness of the associated risks, which leads us to discuss two main strategies: engraving your bitcoins in steel and creating an inheritance plan.

### Engraving in stone

One method to secure your bitcoins in the long term is to engrave your mnemonic phrase on a resistant material like steel. This creates a physical backup of your keys that is resistant to both water damage and fire.

There are many solutions to achieve this, some are low-cost like the "Blockmit," while others require more equipment. You can explore this topic yourself through the tutorials section of this university.

![image](assets/en/chapter8/1.webp)

### Think about the next generation!

Conjointly with this, creating an inheritance plan is also a crucial step to ensure that your bitcoins will be properly managed after your death. This plan can include a handwritten letter detailing your assets, their access methods, and the contact information of trusted individuals to be contacted. It is also important to discuss the inheritance of bitcoins with a notary to ensure tax compliance, although it is important to never directly entrust your bitcoins to a third party, including a notary.

If you wish to further explore the subject of an inheritance plan for your bitcoins, we recommend Pamela Morgan's book [Cryptoasset Inheritance Plan](https://planb.network/resources/books/28) or taking the BTC102 course where we guide you in its creation.

![image](assets/en/chapter8/2.webp)

### Privacy is important

The long-term security of your bitcoins is not limited to creating physical backups or developing an inheritance plan. Privacy is another important consideration. For example, it is preferable to buy bitcoins without providing identification to minimize the risks of identity theft or simply the tracing of your funds by any entity with sufficient means. The BTC 205 course can assist you with this if needed.

Regarding privacy, it is crucial to avoid talking to everyone about your bitcoins. Indeed, we do not know where this asset will go, and maintaining discretion regarding its ownership is a wise decision. You do not want to attract attention to yourself and your wallet.

In the same vein, avoid loudly revealing your security system during bitcoin meetings or encounters with strangers...

### Quick recap in a poster!

### Summary on Bitcoin wallet security

Bitcoin wallets are software that allows you to store and transact bitcoins. There are several types: mobile or PC wallets, convenient for small amounts and/or regular expenses; physical wallets, more suitable for storing bitcoins in the medium and long term; multisig wallets, which are more complex to manage and require multiple signatures to perform transactions.
When creating a wallet, you must first backup your private key. This backup takes the form of a list of 12 or 24 words, or 12 words that you can write on a piece of paper or a metal plate. This mnemonic phrase allows you to restore your wallet on any Bitcoin wallet application. Anyone with access to this list also has access to your bitcoins. In Bitcoin, financial sovereignty goes hand in hand with individual responsibility, so it is crucial that you secure access to your wallets and backups. To do this, it is important to follow certain rules:

- Create an inheritance plan: to ensure that your loved ones can retrieve the money in case of a problem.
- Avoid exchange platforms: it is advisable to avoid leaving your Bitcoins on exchange platforms, as they can be susceptible to hacker attacks.
- Adapt your level of security: take the time to explain your needs and uses, this will help you make your choice among the different Bitcoin wallets available.

Now that we have covered the basics of Bitcoin wallets and best practices for securing them, we will address the technical functioning of Bitcoin in the next chapter. Once again, knowing the basics of the Bitcoin protocol will allow you to better understand its functioning, which will enable you to make better use of it.

## Launching Bitcoin
<chapterId>b7561082-8943-519d-95d1-a5f60dd2686d</chapterId>

### Let's start with a bit of history.

![image](assets/en/chapter9/2.webp)

October 31, 2008 marks the birth of a new financial technology: Bitcoin. It is on this date that Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous author of Bitcoin, presents his innovation to the world through an email distributed to the cypherpunk mailing list, a community of cryptography enthusiasts passionate about privacy on the internet.

This email contained a document, called the "White Paper," which presented the functioning of Bitcoin. Given the previous failures of digital cash systems, this initiative did not immediately generate enthusiasm. Nevertheless, this White Paper eventually became a reference for Bitcoin users and has been the subject of many debates in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

![image](assets/en/chapter9/3.webp)

On January 3, 2009, Satoshi officially inaugurates the Bitcoin network by creating the first block, also known as the genesis block, which marks the launch of the Bitcoin blockchain. This block contains a revealing message about the mission of Bitcoin: "03/jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."

![image](assets/en/chapter9/9.webp)

> "We can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a
> new territory of freedom for several years.” - Satoshi Nakamoto

![image](assets/en/chapter9/7.webp)

### The Bitcoin protocol begins to live

On January 8, 2009, Satoshi announces the release of Bitcoin-0.1.0. Shortly after, Hal Finney takes hold of the software and joins the network. Now, there were 2 nodes, and therefore 2 miners, in the network. Finney immortalizes this step by tweeting "Running Bitcoin". On January 12, 2009, the first Bitcoin transaction is made between Satoshi and Hal Finney. This transaction, of 10 BTC, is recorded in block 170.

![image](assets/en/chapter9/4.webp)

Interest in Bitcoin grows rapidly, and many people begin to test, debate, solve bugs, and reflect on the ethical, economic, and philosophical aspects of Bitcoin. To facilitate these exchanges, the BitcoinTalk forum is created on November 22, 2009 by Satoshi.
This forum quickly becomes the preferred place of discussion for Bitcoin users. It is there that many memes and symbols associated with Bitcoin are born, such as the [Bitcoin logo](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0), the famous [Hodl](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0), or even [Pizza day](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195).

> **Did you know?** Indeed, on May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz made history with Bitcoin by offering to buy 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC. This is the first time that Bitcoin is used to purchase physical goods.

![image](assets/en/chapter9/6.webp)

### The disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto

In 2010, as Bitcoin begins to attract media attention, Satoshi decides to distance himself. On December 12, 2010, he publishes his last post on the forum, announcing his departure. On April 23, 2011, he makes his last known private exchange via email. Satoshi then disappears, leaving his creation in the hands of the community.

> “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally
> controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like
> Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.” - Satoshi Nakamoto

Despite Satoshi's absence, Bitcoin continues to develop. Every 10 minutes, the history of Bitcoin is written, and the protocol continues to function as intended. Regardless of fear, uncertainty, or doubt (FOMO for Fear Of Missing Out or FUD for Fear Uncertainty Doubt), Bitcoin continues to move forward, with an online availability of 99.988%.

Bitcoin is perceived differently by each individual. For some, it's a fungal entity like [mycelium](https://brandonquittem.com/bitcoin-is-the-mycelium-of-money/), for others it's a [black hole](https://dergigi.com/2019/05/01/bitcoins-gravity/i). Love it or hate it, Bitcoin continues to exist, with its constant rhythm of 10 minutes per block, like the heartbeat of a new monetary system.

To learn more about Satoshi Nakamoto's writings, I recommend [Phil Champagne's book](https://planb.network/resources/books) or the ARTE documentary "le mystaire Satoshi".

![image](assets/en/chapter9/8.webp)

> “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”

Now that we have some background, let's take a look at how a Bitcoin transaction works in general.

### Quick recap in a poster!

![Alt text](assets/posters/en/7._lancement_bitcoin.webp)

## Bitcoin transactions
<chapterId>03482644-5473-590b-975b-b43bb65eac21</chapterId>

A Bitcoin transaction is simply a transfer of ownership of bitcoins, using a Bitcoin address. Let's take, for example, two protagonists: Alice and Bob. Alice wishes to acquire bitcoins, while Bob already owns some.

### Step 1 - Creating the transaction via the wallet

For Bob to transfer bitcoins to Alice, Alice must provide Bob with one of her Bitcoin addresses. This address, derived from Alice's public key, is unique to her Bitcoin wallet.

In concrete terms, Alice opens her wallet and presses "receive". A QR code or address like this bc1q7957hh3nj47efn8t2r6xdzs2cy3wjcyp8pch6hfkggy7jwrzj93sv4uykr will be displayed. It's her "Bitcoin IBAN" of sorts. She provides it to Bob.

Bob then initiates the transaction using Alice's reception address. Bob in turn opens his Bitcoin wallet, presses "send", copies and pastes the address, adds an amount and a transaction fee. These fees are an incentive for miners to include the transaction in the next block.

![image](assets/en/chapter10/1.webp)

> **Why pay fees?** These fees are essential to create a free market for including transactions in blocks, as the number of transactions in a block is limited. In fact, a block has a size of 1 MB (can expand to 4MB after Segwit update), which corresponds to a few thousand transactions per block. The fees of a transaction are proportional to its size. The size of the transaction, in turn, depends on the complexity of the transaction.

To finalize the transaction, Bob must provide a signature with the private key of the addresses he uses to pay Alice. This verifies that he is the owner of the bitcoins he wants to transfer. This step is usually done automatically on mobile wallets, or it is a confirmation on your physical wallet: "Are you sure you want to send X to Y? Yes or no".

### Step 2: Propagation of the transaction through nodes to miners

At this stage, the transaction has been created and Bob's wallet will share it with the Bitcoin network. To do this, his wallet will communicate with a node of the Bitcoin network, and this node will propagate this information to other nodes. This propagation step allows the entire network to see this new transaction and take it into account.

![image](assets/en/chapter10/4.webp)

Although this transaction is now known to everyone (via a tool called Mempool), the transaction is not necessarily considered confirmed! Indeed, it is the miners who validate the transactions by including them in a block of our famous blockchain.

Miners have the role of taking valid and unconfirmed transactions, and then compiling them into a block. In order for their block to be the next one in the Bitcoin blockchain, they must solve a cryptographic puzzle in a process called "proof of work".

![image](assets/en/chapter10/2.webp)

### Step 3: The transaction is mined in a block by a miner.

This proof of work requires finding a valid "hash" for the block in question. Think of it as a unique fingerprint associated with the block, composed of 256 characters. The validity of this hash depends on the difficulty of the Bitcoin network. We will go into more detail on this mechanism later. For now, consider that a miner has found a valid block and that Bob's transaction to Alice is included in it.

This new valid block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain, which is a public and immutable ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. Think of it as a common ledger for all Bitcoin users. According to the protocol rules, a block is added approximately every ten minutes thanks to the difficulty adjustment. We will see in the section on miners what mechanism prevents the modification of the Bitcoin transaction ledger.

![image](assets/en/chapter10/5.webp)

### Step 4: The block is valid and verified by Alice's wallet node.

At this stage, the transaction is considered valid, the miner will then propagate the new block through their node to the network, and Alice's wallet will be updated.

![image](assets/en/chapter10/3.webp)

> Note: Even if Alice sees that she has received bitcoins on one of her addresses, it is recommended to consider the transaction as immutable only when it has 6 confirmations. This means that 6 other blocks have been mined on top of the block containing Bob's transaction. In other words, the older a transaction is in the blockchain, the more immutable it becomes.

### Quick recap in a poster!

![Explanation of a transaction](assets/posters/fr/11_explication_d_une_transaction_crop.webp)

### What's the point of all this?

In the end, the Bitcoin transaction system is decentralized and works peer-to-peer, without any trusted intermediaries.

Bob sends his transaction to the Bitcoin network, and when a miner publishes a valid block containing Bob's transaction, Alice can start considering that the bitcoins belong to her. Trust is not required at any step of the bitcoin ownership transfer; only the protocol rules and economic incentives make it too costly to act maliciously within the Bitcoin protocol.

Users transfer ownership of their money by digitally signing transactions with their private keys. Miners hold little power, as users also have significant control through Bitcoin nodes that handle the validation of new blocks and included transactions. It is through this network of Bitcoin nodes that the network is truly decentralized.

In fact, for the Bitcoin network to be completely destroyed, all copies of the blockchain on all Bitcoin nodes would have to be destroyed - a practically impossible task due to the geographical distribution of these nodes and the difficulty of physically seizing them.

Let's take a closer look at how a Bitcoin node works.

## Bitcoin Nodes
<chapterId>8533cebc-f799-528b-89df-8d75d4c37f1c</chapterId>

Nodes are a fundamental element of the Bitcoin network architecture. They perform various crucial functions:

- Maintaining a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain
- Validating transactions
- Transmitting information to other nodes
- Enforcing the rules of the Bitcoin protocol.

Therefore, any device running Bitcoin software, called Bitcoin nodes (often through [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/)), contributes to the decentralization of the network.

![image](assets/en/chapter11/1.webp)

### Nodes are thus the central core of Bitcoin.

Each node holds a copy of the blockchain, which allows for transaction verification and prevents any attempt at fraud. The decentralized aspect of the network gives Bitcoin exceptional resilience and robustness - to stop the Bitcoin protocol, all nodes around the world would have to be shut down. For your information, there are currently (September 2023) approximately [45,000 nodes](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/) distributed across the globe.

Nodes are capable of verifying the validity of blocks and transactions because they follow the rules of the Bitcoin consensus. These rules govern, among other things, Bitcoin's monetary policy such as the amount of miners' reward (which we will discuss in more detail in the next section) and the amount of bitcoin in circulation. Nodes act as the network's legal system in a way. Thanks to them, all network participants follow the same rules. They ensure the neutrality of the Bitcoin protocol. The consensus rules vary very little, if at all, because to make changes, the approval of all nodes is required.

![image](assets/en/chapter11/2.webp)

Governance within the protocol is beyond the scope of this training, but know that each user running a Bitcoin node decides which rules they want to follow. Thus, a user could decide to follow other rules (i.e., make modifications to the code), but if these modifications invalidate the current consensus rules, then this node will no longer be part of the Bitcoin network. Major modifications are therefore rare and require significant coordination among thousands of actors with varied ideologies and interests, which forces the protocol to only produce updates that make it "better" in the sense of all Bitcoin users.

### What does a node look like?

There are several options available to us when we want to have our own node, and their maintenance costs vary. You can simply run the Bitcoin Core software on your computer, but this will require a significant amount of storage space as the blockchain is about ~500GB. To overcome this constraint, you can choose to only keep the last N blocks in memory, which is called a "pruned node". For this kind of solution, the cost is negligible because the node is only turned on when you need it.

![image](assets/en/chapter11/10.webp)

A second option is to use dedicated hardware for this purpose, such as Raspberry Pi 4 with a sufficiently large SSD (about ~1TB). This second option is more expensive if you have to buy the hardware, but in terms of electricity consumption, it represents a little less than €10 per year.
From a bandwidth perspective, considering 1 block of 1MB every 10 minutes, this represents approximately 5GB per month.

### Nodes must remain accessible to everyone!

The affordable cost and accessibility of a Bitcoin node in terms of hardware resources, storage, and bandwidth is a very important aspect as it facilitates the decentralization of the network.

Indeed, everyone has a good reason to run a node! The price and effort are minimal for the benefit obtained. You just have to embark on the adventure and join thousands of other bitcoiners because together we form the Bitcoin network.

![image](assets/en/chapter11/11.webp)

For example, if the blocks were 100 times heavier, we could certainly make 100 times more transactions every 10 minutes, but running a Bitcoin node would require a 50TB hard disk, a bandwidth of over 500GB/month, and hardware capable of validating hundreds of thousands of transactions in less than 10 minutes. In this hypothetical situation with 100 times larger blocks, running a Bitcoin node would not be accessible to the average person, which would compromise the decentralization of the protocol and the immutability of transactions and consensus rules. Thus, the protocol constraints have also been chosen to allow as many people as possible to run their own Bitcoin node.

This situation is not so hypothetical because the year 2017 was marked by an intense controversy known as the "block war". This conflict opposed actors who wanted to modify Bitcoin by increasing the block size to increase transaction capacity, to those who sought to preserve the independence and power of users. In the end, users and nodes triumphed by rejecting the proposed change initiated by miners, exchange platforms, and institutions.

Following this victory, the nodes activated an update called SegWit, paving the way for the implementation of the Lightning Network, an instant Bitcoin payment network using the Bitcoin blockchain. This situation demonstrates that users, through their nodes, hold real power within Bitcoin, allowing them to stand up to large institutions.

## Miners
<chapterId>dbb8264a-7434-57e4-9d1b-fbd1bae37fdf</chapterId>

> Miners serve to secure the network and add transactions to the blocks. They use electricity through ASIC machines to solve the Bitcoin proof of work.

![image](assets/en/chapter12/15.webp)

### Explanation of Proof of Work

The Proof of Work, also known as "Proof of Work" (POW), is the security consensus of the Bitcoin protocol. It is the rule that allows Bitcoin to operate and ensure its robustness. POW is the foundation of everything and plays a crucial role in the game theory of Bitcoin.

Think of it as a giant lottery where everyone can participate. The goal is to find a specific number that will allow for the signing of a valid block, and the winner receives a reward in bitcoin. This number is very simple to verify but difficult to find. In fact, the easy verification is done through the SHA-256 hash function, which is included in the mining algorithm. In order to find this number, participants (miners) will attempt billions upon billions of possibilities, such as 1, 52, 2648, 26874615, 15344854131318631, etc.

If the chosen number is correct: Jackpot! Otherwise, the search continues. To optimize the number of attempts, they will use specific machines called ASICs, which have the sole role of calculating billions of possibilities per second. The total quantity of attempts is called the HashRate and allows for quantifying the security of the Bitcoin protocol. To operate these machines, large quantities of electricity must be consumed. Therefore, POW transforms energy into currency, connecting the real world and the digital world to create the first energy-based currency.

The machines run, and after an average of 10 minutes, a winner will emerge. They will have found the correct hash below the difficulty threshold. The grand and sole winner will then sign the new block of the timestamp server and continue the blockchain. The winner receives their rewards and returns to try their luck for the next block. The process has been repeating for 12 years, and every 10 minutes, a winner confirms Bitcoin transactions while continuing to secure past transactions. Making our Bitcoin blockchain more robust and secure.

Every 2 weeks (2016 blocks), the difficulty adjustment rebalances the global mining game based on the number of participants.

![image](assets/en/chapter12/14.webp)

### Mining is constantly evolving

Over the years, miners have equipped themselves with increasingly efficient computer hardware to produce as many hashes as possible per second (called HashRate) while consuming the least amount of energy in the most cost-effective way possible. The early miners like Satoshi or Hal Finney mined with just their CPU, then others started mining with their graphics card. Nowadays, miners use what are called ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), machines designed solely for applying the SHA256 algorithm.

![image](assets/en/chapter12/20.webp)

The Hashrate of the Bitcoin network represents the number of attempts made per second to find the next block. Today it is about 400 TH/s, which is 400,000 billion attempts per second! The higher the global hashrate, the more difficult it is for a malicious actor to monopolize the resources needed to obtain a majority of the mining and perform a double spend. It is therefore more economically viable to follow the rules of the Bitcoin protocol than to act against them. This raises a question: how do miners get paid?

![image](assets/en/chapter12/16.webp)

### What can be found in a block?

![image](assets/en/chapter12/20.webp)

The block header contains several elements such as the time, the difficulty target, the number of the last block, the version used, and the Merkel Root of the previous transactions.

The coinbase transaction is always the first one; it includes the reward received for performing the validator's work. Then come the validated transactions. The miner will choose the transactions that pay the most and try to create a block that maximizes their income, namely small-sized transactions with maximum fees.

### Miners' compensation

Initially, a miner is compensated when they find a valid block. More precisely, they are compensated in two ways: (i) through the subsidy (newly minted bitcoins) included in the block and (ii) through transaction fees in the transactions included in the block. The amount of the subsidy is defined by the consensus rules and depends on the Epoch we are in. Block reward = Block subsidy + transaction fees.

Indeed, for the first blocks, the block subsidy was 50 bitcoins, then every 210,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years), it is halved. Today (in 2023), we are in the 4th Epoch; therefore, the subsidy is 6.25 bitcoins. This subsidy is the mechanism for creating new bitcoins in Bitcoin. As the subsidy decreases over time, it means that there is a limit of 21 million bitcoins - currently, there are already over 19.4 million bitcoins in circulation, which is over 92%.

![image](assets/en/chapter12/18.webp)

The second method of compensation is defined by the amount chosen by users for transaction fees. Since the miner wants to maximize their income, they will tend to prioritize transactions with high transaction fees; the transaction fees reflect the urgency of the user to have their transaction included in the next block.

![image](assets/en/chapter12/17.webp)

Furthermore, to stabilize the miners' economic model, which relies on the rewards they receive for each valid block, miners often collaborate in groups through "mining pools," where they pool their computing resources.

### Why bother doing all this?

In short, the innovation of Bitcoin is to propose a solution to the problem of double spending through the use of a blockchain based on Proof of Work with a floating difficulty. In the digital world, the concept of ownership differs from that of the physical world. Indeed, in the digital world, everything can be copied and pasted, which poses problems in terms of double spending for digital assets of value. Trusted intermediaries, such as banks, have been created to solve this technological problem and ensure that when an asset is transferred, it no longer belongs to the sender. But how can this be done without a trusted intermediary? This problem is equivalent to the Byzantine Generals' Problem, a problem of coordinating information in a system where the various actors cannot be trusted.

![image](assets/en/chapter12/13.webp)

Bitcoin is therefore a kind of solution to solve this problem, or at least to work around it. The "generals" of Bitcoin, or miners, produce blocks (of information) and Bitcoin nodes verify financial transactions using consensus rules to ensure the authenticity of the information. The asymmetry in the energy cost between information production and verification ensures the reliability of the information, without a trusted third party.

Miners are the builders of the security of the Bitcoin network. By spending energy to produce hashes, they build a wall that makes it extremely costly for a malicious agent to rewrite the transaction history. This economic disincentive deters them from behaving dishonestly.

Even in the case of a 51% attack, meaning that an agent possesses more than half of the hashrate, the network remains secure because the attacker must spend as much energy as all the miners combined to attempt to modify the blockchain. It is thanks to this mechanism of proof of work, which requires energy to be accomplished, that the network is secure.

### In summary

The theory of game applied to Bitcoin eliminates dishonest miners. Miners use ASIC machines to mine and receive a reward in case of success. Additionally, they often join mining pools to share their computing power and receive smaller but more regular rewards. Bitcoin mining is a process with a high energy cost but is essential for the functioning and security of the Bitcoin network. Proof of work and the blockchain solve the problem of double spending and ensure the veracity of information without any trusted third party. The energy expenditure is necessary to produce the information, but the verification of information has a negligible cost. This asymmetry guarantees the security of the network. Therefore, it is more economically viable to follow the consensus rules than to break them.

### Quick recap in a poster!

![miners](assets/posters/fr/13_explication_des_mineurs_crop.webp)

## Bitcoin and Ecology
<chapterId>4b227ae6-443a-5739-b443-60b7931130d9</chapterId>

We have just seen in the previous section that the security of the Bitcoin protocol relies on a high energy cost to produce a public ledger of transactions without a trusted third party. The overall energy cost is often compared to the electricity consumption of a small country. But does this comparison make sense? Is it relevant to understand the reasons behind such a cost?

### The energy costs of Bitcoin.

First, let's qualitatively assess the environmental cost of mining. A miner must have a machine like an ASIC and a source of energy in the form of electricity to power these machines. ASICs are mostly made of aluminum and can be either recycled or reused for a second purpose (as demonstrated with the [Attakaï project](https://decouvrebitcoin.fr/attakai/), which transforms an Antminer S9 into a space heater). The main concern is therefore the energy consumption. Let's try to provide more context to this.

![image](assets/en/chapter13/1.webp)

The electricity consumption represents almost all of the costs for a miner. Therefore, they are encouraged to find a cheap source of electricity. However, since miners are mobile, they can go to places where power plants are installed but not yet connected to the electrical grid of the territory. Miners act as a last resort buyer, allowing power plants to secure financing even before being connected to the electrical network. And when they are connected, the demand for electricity will increase, which will raise the price and make it less profitable for the miner to obtain electricity in these places. The miner will then decide to move their installation and settle further away where the demand is low and therefore the price as well.

### An endless debate

Thus, the debate on the ecological impact of Bitcoin is often misguided, mainly due to an insufficient understanding of its usefulness and operation. Bitcoin cannot be evaluated simply in terms of energy cost per transaction, as miners secure both the current and historical network, transactions are grouped and not all equivalent, and the impact of the Lightning Network is not taken into account. Those who claim that Bitcoin consumes too much energy may have political motivations or seek to sell their own blockchain solution. The ecological pretext is used to justify the banning of Bitcoin.

However, it should not be forgotten that Bitcoin, as a revolutionary invention, has given individuals living under financial oppression or a dictatorial regime a means to fight for their freedom. As a last resort, Bitcoin offers a form of financial freedom by escaping censorship and banking restrictions. Bitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a form of communication and expression of freedom. The energy spent by miners contributes to the defense of our freedom. Bitcoin allows for the emancipation from the current financial system, dominated by debt and excessive monetary creation by central banks.

![image](assets/en/chapter13/3.webp)

For those living in countries with high inflation, Bitcoin is a matter of survival. It provides a means to survive in precarious financial situations. Furthermore, Bitcoin offers a fairer and more equitable financial system. It also provides an opportunity for billions of people around the world to access the financial system. Seen from this perspective, is the energy consumption legitimate?

### Could Bitcoin be a net positive for the environment?

Finally, it is essential to discuss the economic and environmental issues of Bitcoin adoption.

Especially when comparing it to the current financial system. The latter, due to its encouragement of overconsumption and debt, poses serious problems. Easy access to credit, monetary issuance by banks, and the use of fractional reserve banking are all factors that promote overindebtedness and, consequently, overconsumption.

![image](assets/en/chapter13/12.webp)

It is necessary to reform the monetary system in order to reflect the scarcity of our resources with the scarcity of our currency. This will encourage more responsible consumption and a long-term vision. Conversely, inflation, by encouraging consumption and investment, has a negative long-term impact on the environment.

The current financial system aligns with the ideas of Keynesian economics, which, unlike Austrian economics, does not take into account the temporal and dynamic aspects of situations and resources. In other words, an unlimited currency cannot effectively reflect the limited resources of our planet.

![image](assets/en/chapter13/2.webp)

Politicians, due to their short-term vision and their need for economic growth to be reelected, are not able to solve ecological problems in the long term. Conversely, the adoption of a sound currency like Bitcoin is a potential alternative that could empower the people economically.

The flames in oil wells, which burn methane to prevent pollution, can be extinguished by Bitcoin miners, which is beneficial for the environment. Bitcoin promotes the use of green energy. Methane can be converted into electricity to power mining machines, which is advantageous for everyone.

The technology of Bitcoin is often misunderstood, and criticisms regarding its environmental impact are often simplistic and short-term. These criticisms are often motivated by political interests. Bitcoin has the potential to help with the ecological transition and contribute to a greener world. The media often spreads false ideas about Bitcoin and ecology. So take the time to form your own opinion. Everything is transparent with Bitcoin.

> Follow one of Bitcoin's maxims: Don't trust, verify for yourself!

### Quick recap in a poster!

![Bitcoin & ecology](assets/posters/fr/14_minage_et_ecologie_crop.webp)

### Brief summary of the technical aspects of Bitcoin

Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin protocol in January 2009, which has since evolved thanks to a growing community of developers, miners, and users with Bitcoin nodes. By keeping their own copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions, these nodes can ensure the validity of transactions according to Bitcoin's consensus rules. This includes ensuring that miners produce valid blocks, which contain thousands of pending transactions.

On average, a block is created every 10 minutes, and the miner who finds a valid hash for the next block is rewarded by the protocol with a reward whose amount is defined by the consensus rules, as well as the transaction fees from all transactions included in the valid block. Since the result of the hashing algorithm (SHA256) for a given input is considered unpredictable, the mining process involves building numerous candidate blocks and testing if their hash is valid or not. However, to ensure that the average time between two blocks remains constant (~10 mins) regardless of the number of miners and their computing power, the difficulty of finding a valid hash adjusts every 2016 blocks, approximately every 2 weeks. Miners have developed specialized SHA256 machines over time, called ASICS, to increase the hash rate per joule, which means the number of attempts per second and per consumed energy.

In order for miners to be as profitable as possible in their activity, they must obtain the cheapest electricity possible, which is often in remote locations, within power plants that are not yet connected to the grid. The miner then acts as a buyer of last resort, and as soon as the price of electricity increases due to an increase in demand, the miner will tend to relocate their activity elsewhere.

Thus, the Bitcoin protocol is an uncensorable and unstoppable monetary system because each component of the protocol is distributed geographically across the globe - for example, there are approximately 40,000 Bitcoin nodes across all continents. Bitcoin's consensus rules are such that it is economically more profitable to follow them than to try to break them, and therefore no trust is required between actors. Bitcoin has no leader and cannot be stopped. It is possible to regulate exchange platforms to limit Bitcoin, but this is limited in terms of impact. In short, no judge or state can censor or stop Bitcoin.

## Bitcoin never sleeps!
<chapterId>d5e35e41-ea26-5478-8eb9-07daf9dff508</chapterId>

The price of Bitcoin is often characterized by significant volatility. Its value can fluctuate considerably depending on market variations and bullish and bearish market phases. This is present in 100% of financial markets, including Bitcoin.

![image](assets/en/chapter14/2.webp)

> To put it simply: humans buy all at the same time and sell all at the same time. Bitcoin is not immune to human nature.

### Understanding Adoption Waves

The development and evolution of Bitcoin are largely linked to the different groups of actors who have gradually integrated its ecosystem.

![image](assets/en/chapter14/1.webp)

- The believers:

The early users of Bitcoin were mainly technophiles, cypherpunks, libertarians, and gold enthusiasts. These groups were attracted to Bitcoin because of its ability to offer solutions such as trustless electronic cash, resistance to censorship, or transparent and immutable monetary policy.

- The dark web & criminals

Then, the use of Bitcoin expanded to dark web marketplaces like Silk Road due to its uncontrollable and pseudonymous nature. This site drew attention to the uncontrollable and pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin, which prompted some criminal actors to use it. However, it should be noted that it is the use of a tool, not the tool itself, that determines its legality or illegality. It should be noted that the illegal use of Bitcoin does not make a person a criminal in itself. It is the use, not the tool, that can be classified as illegal. For example, the use of Bitcoin for activities such as purchasing certain drugs may be legal or illegal depending on the regulations of the territory where the activity takes place.

- The ICO frenzy and the arrival of the general public.

The year 2017 was marked by a significant speculative bubble in the cryptocurrency world, especially with the launch of thousands of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). However, many of these new cryptocurrencies had no concrete development or utility and quickly disappeared. This 2017 bubble was followed by a strong correction in 2018-2019.

- The NFT bubble and DeFi

Then again in 2020, the market experienced another speculative bubble that drove the price of Bitcoin to $60,000. This bubble is distinguished from previous ones by a greater diversification of investors, including financial institutions and large companies. But once again, strong corrections occur once the euphoria subsides.

### Bitcoin & Volatility

Based on past cycles, it seems that the periodicity of Bitcoin's economic cycles is equivalent to the duration between two halvings. Perhaps because the halving event acts as a trigger by halving the emission of new bitcoins.

These significant fluctuations have created a reputation for bitcoin as an extremely dangerous asset that causes its users to lose money. Although the price can drop by 10-20 or even 50% in a few days, it is important to understand that Bitcoin, the protocol, is not affected by price changes.

This significant volatility is fully accepted today by Bitcoin actors and can be mitigated by several solutions such as financial hedges (stablecoins), a strong long-term belief (hodling), or simply not putting 100% of one's money into Bitcoin without understanding anything. Understanding why the price of bitcoin fluctuates so much is therefore essential to be able to progress in this industry because ultimately, it is the price and cycles that temper and regulate our market to some extent. However, we can note that as Bitcoin grows and matures, volatility becomes less significant.

![image](assets/en/chapter14/5.webp)

Although the btc/dollar pair fluctuates in the short term, bitcoin, due to its limited quantity of 21 million bitcoins and its halving process (halving the monetary creation every 4 years on average), follows a general upward trend in a quasi-mechanical manner. Of course, like any financial asset, bitcoin is subject to economic cycles including periods of euphoria, speculative bubbles, and corrections. This phenomenon is quite common in emerging technologies, where the market is not always rational or efficient.

### A unique market

These cycles of speculative bubbles are quite unique in the world, as it is very rare for the same asset to experience so many bubbles one after another. This can be explained simply because bitcoin is not a bubble that will disappear but a currency that is actually used everywhere in the world. The Bitcoin protocol is unique in that it operates on a global scale, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, making regulation difficult for financial authorities.

![image](assets/en/chapter14/4.webp)

Today, in 2023, Bitcoin continues to survive and grow even more by integrating itself more and more into the traditional market. The upcoming arrival of Bitcoin ETFs, clearer regulation, and better acquisition or storage tools only encourage this trend. Bitcoin has ONCE AGAIN survived its speculative bubble, so maybe it's not all hot air!

<chapterId>be2d83be-406f-582c-83ca-6aa905ff7b04</chapterId>

### A parallel economy is developing

Bitcoin can be seen as a parallel economy to fiat currencies. This means that it is possible to sell goods or services and be paid in bitcoin. Transactions can be made directly in bitcoin, without the need to go through an exchange platform, simply from Bitcoin wallet to Bitcoin wallet.

The Bitcoin economy exists and is developing in certain regions of the world, such as El Salvador where bitcoin has been legal tender since 2021. Furthermore, some individuals, businesses, and organizations already accept Bitcoin as a means of payment for their products or services.

![image](assets/en/chapter16/6.webp)

In addition, to facilitate the use of bitcoin in everyday transactions, an open-source and collaborative project has been launched: BTCMap (https://btcmap.org/map#2/21.28937/5.46680). This platform lists all the merchants that accept bitcoin as well as the different Bitcoin communities around the world. You can visit their website to discover the Bitcoin ecosystem around you. Thus, despite the difficulties and hesitations, there are initiatives like BTCMap that contribute to making the Bitcoin economy more accessible and convenient for everyone.

### Why accept Bitcoin instead of buying it?

To obtain bitcoins, you can buy them on platforms regulated by organizations such as the AMF (Autorité des Marchés Financiers) in France. This method involves certain risks and the traceability of your transactions. Another method to obtain bitcoins is to accept them as a means of payment for the products or services you offer. This method allows you to acquire bitcoins through your work without constantly worrying about the price of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, accepting Bitcoin as a merchant has several advantages, including censorship resistance, reduced transaction fees, increased efficiency, protection against inflation, as well as financial freedom and sovereignty.

![image](assets/en/chapter16/3.webp)

### How to proceed:

To accept Bitcoin, it is necessary to study the different available solutions and choose the one that best suits your business. There is no perfect solution, and several factors must be taken into account to make your choice, such as the expected transaction volume, allocated budget, and type of business (online or physical).

We will cover this topic in detail in another training, but to keep it simple, we can consider several categories of businesses and therefore related solutions:

- Simple online solution: OpenNode
- Solution for amateur merchants: Swiss Bitcoin Pay
- Solution for large structures or passionate bitcoiners: BTCpay Server

## Saving with Bitcoin
<chapterId>1d9570c6-5b63-51a6-b87c-7bdb0fc4aa87</chapterId>

### Warning before getting started!

Bitcoin has become a major financial asset, mainly due to its limited supply and increasing demand. However, buying bitcoin carries risks that require special attention. It is therefore recommended to conduct your own research and learn more about the subject to become familiar with the technology before investing.

- Only invest what you can afford to lose.
- Bitcoin is a highly volatile financial asset; its price can drop to 0.
- Past performance is not indicative of future performance.
- Contact your financial advisor if needed.

> DécouvreBitcoin (Rogzy) does not provide investment advice and nothing stated here should be considered as such.

### Mini Checklist before taking the plunge

Before diving into buying bitcoin, make sure you have:

- A secure wallet.
- A solid understanding of Bitcoin.
- A savings plan to follow.
- A long-term vision.

If the subject is still unclear, know that the BTC102 course will guide you in securing and acquiring your first bitcoins. Here, we will only skim the surface of the topic.

In concrete terms, there are two questions to ask yourself:

- What acquisition strategy to adopt: gradually or all at once?
- Which platform to use: regulated or unregulated?

### Acquisition strategies

- Dollar Cost Average

Recurring purchases involve buying small amounts of bitcoin at regular intervals. This method smooths out the price over time and provides continuous growth in the amount of bitcoin owned. It is an ideal solution for long-term savings without worrying about the price and volatility of bitcoin. Set it up and forget about it.

![image](assets/en/chapter15/2.webp)

> Beware of UTXOs: Remember to consolidate your UTXOs in your wallets from time to time. This practice is essential for effectively managing your bitcoins and avoiding unnecessary fees during transactions.

- Spontaneous purchase

Spontaneous purchase is used to immediately gain exposure to bitcoin. Whether it's buying during a crash or taking advantage of a bonus, the decision is yours. You will need to muster up your courage and press the buy button.

Given the significant volatility of bitcoin, special attention must be paid to your emotions. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) are your worst enemies in this context! Stay calm and follow the strategy you have established in advance to avoid impulsive and potentially harmful decision-making.

### Who should we buy our bitcoin from?

There are several ways to acquire bitcoins, each with its own regulations. Some platforms require identification for verification, while others do not. It is crucial to understand the regulations associated with each platform.

- DCA platforms

A common method of accumulating bitcoins is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves regularly investing small amounts. Several platforms offer this service, such as those listed on our [dedicated page](https://planb.network/tutorials/exchange). In addition to the simplicity of setting up a DCA, withdrawals to your wallet are generally automatic, meaning you will always have control over your assets.

Today, almost all DCA solutions are relatively efficient and have almost similar fees, so the choice will depend more on availability in your country.

- Broker platforms

For large-scale investments, regulated and recognized platforms such as Kraken, Bitstamp, and Paymium are recommended. These platforms offer a safe and secure environment for high-volume transactions.

Their use is simple and accessible to everyone:

1. Set up a KYC/\* account
2. Transfer funds to your account
3. Purchase bitcoin
4. Withdraw bitcoin to your wallet

![image](assets/en/chapter15/1.webp)

After the purchase, it is advisable to immediately withdraw the bitcoins from the exchange platforms to minimize the risks of hacking and fund blocking. Withdrawal fees can be high, sometimes up to 25 euros depending on the platform.

> Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations require users to provide identification to combat terrorism financing, tax evasion, and money laundering.

It is important to note that KYC is an important topic in our industry as its effectiveness remains easily debatable while its negative aspects are numerous. In many of our university's training programs and content, we advise against using full KYC platforms if you are already an advanced user.

### Non-KYC Solution

In addition, there are several [marketplaces](https://planb.network/tutorials/exchange) to buy and sell bitcoins peer-to-peer. If you are interested in these, you can take our BTC 205 course on the subject. Generally, these solutions are:

- Bitcoin ATMs
- Physical meetings with other bitcoin enthusiasts
- Illegal and unregulated platforms
- Peer-to-peer matchmaking solutions
- Neobanks operating in Bitcoin-friendly nations.

![image](assets/en/chapter15/3.webp)

It is also important to note that taxes may be implemented in your jurisdiction. We invite you to consult the regulations of your country before taking any action that may put you at risk.

## Hyper-bitcoinization
<chapterId>b7275d31-3b60-5fb7-b9f5-030097010553</chapterId>

### The wild race is just beginning!

Like any new technology, the adoption of Bitcoin follows an S-curve. We have surpassed the era of early adopters and the indicators seem to point towards a complete democratization of Bitcoin. It is a viral technology that cannot be stopped. El Salvador has taken the bold gamble of adopting Bitcoin in its entirety, declaring it as a legal tender. However, each country reacts differently to this technology. Some have banned and criminalized its use, adding to the complexity of Bitcoin adoption based on cultures, eras, and nations.

![image](assets/en/chapter17/2.webp)

The rise of Bitcoin forces companies, universities, regulators, and individuals to take this new technology into account. New tools need to be created, services need to be adapted, and innovation must continue to ensure their survival. This context raises many questions related to various fields, including cryptography, game theory, economics and monetary policy, computer science, philosophy, energy, laws, and regulation. In short, Bitcoin is a multidisciplinary object.

![image](assets/en/chapter17/1.webp)

### Bitcoin is a 0 to 1

We invite you to reflect on this new monetary revolution. There is so much to explore with Bitcoin that it is complicated to assimilate everything at once. Take your time, Bitcoin is not going to disappear. On the contrary, the revolution has just begun. Together, we believe that we are capable of creating the world we want to entrust to our children. A world where human sovereignty is a right, where privacy is respected by default, and where money is not manipulated. We hope that together we will achieve this.

![image](assets/en/chapter17/3.webp)

If you want to expand your knowledge about Bitcoin, a large number of authors, thinkers, and essayists have contributed to the educational layer of Bitcoin.

> Milton Friedman, a renowned economist, predicted in 1999: "I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that's missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash - a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A."

# The Future of Bitcoin: The Lightning Network
<partId>899fd35e-39e6-5a25-a73e-6fed6e725094</partId>

## A Brief Introduction to the Lightning Network
<chapterId>b403f1e4-f1ff-572b-a242-9b58cb3736d0</chapterId>

Now that we have the basics of the Bitcoin protocol, we will introduce a payment network that uses the Bitcoin protocol to enable lightning-fast transactions. We are obviously talking about the Lightning Network!

### In a Nutshell

The Lightning Network is a revolutionary technology that has profoundly changed our perception of Bitcoin. It is a solution that addresses the scalability issue of Bitcoin.

To fully grasp the Lightning Network, it is crucial to understand how Bitcoin evolves. Bitcoin develops in infrastructure layers: the first layer is the blockchain, and the second layer is the Lightning Network.

Recognized as a layer of Bitcoin, the Lightning Network was validated and implemented in 2017. It allows for instant, low-cost Bitcoin transactions, thus solving the scalability problem of Bitcoin. But what is this scalability problem that Bitcoin faces?

### A Blockchain Cannot Grow Indefinitely

The scalability problem refers to the challenge of implementing a monetary system capable of providing an ever-increasing number of transactions per second as it is adopted. This relates to the blockchain trilemma. Imagine a triangle with decentralization, security, and scalability as its vertices.

A protocol based on a blockchain can only satisfy two out of these 3 aspects. Within the Bitcoin protocol, choices have been made to favor decentralization/security. On one hand, the block size of 1MB and the time between two blocks (on average 10 minutes) allow for running a Bitcoin node at a lower cost, favoring decentralization. On the other hand, the production of blocks through Proof-of-Work makes fraud within the protocol extremely costly while facilitating verification by network nodes, thus favoring security. However, these choices impose a limit on the average number of transactions in a block, roughly corresponding to a few transactions per second. This number is ridiculous when compared to the processing capacity of payment processors like VISA, which is 1700/s. However, this limit is necessary in order to transact with Bitcoin in a censorship-resistant and trustless manner. Nevertheless, those developing on Bitcoin have been thinking about this problem since the beginning.

### Lightning as a Layer on Top

After years of reflection and multiple attempts, the Lightning protocol emerges. Using a certain number of specifications, this protocol allows for the construction of a peer-to-peer payment network by leveraging the security and programmability of Bitcoin's transaction protocol. The Lightning Network acts as a network of payment channels, enabling instant transactions with low fees for the sender. This network of payment channels even makes it possible to transact between individuals who do not have a direct channel connection.

Traditional money transfer services such as Western Union, central banks, Visa, and Mastercard could disappear if they do not adopt Lightning Network technology. The Lightning Network is more efficient and cost-effective than current payment systems. Indeed, the Lightning Network allows for nearly unlimited transactions between two peers sharing a channel, without energy expenses on the base blockchain other than the transaction to announce the creation of the channel.

Transactions are secured through cryptography and indirectly through the energy consumed by miners on Bitcoin. Transactions can be made instantly, without geographical limitations, and fees are extremely low, often less than 0.5%.

In summary, the Lightning Network is a promising attempt to deploy an efficient payment system for transacting in Bitcoin. There are already numerous Lightning wallets available, which you can discover in our tutorial section or through our Lightning Network training.

## Use Cases of the Lightning Network
<chapterId>684e31f9-ebd1-51b6-91c0-1e6a315f1141</chapterId>

As we have just seen, the Bitcoin protocol, although revolutionary, faces significant challenges in terms of scalability in order to handle all of our daily transactions. To solve these problems, a second layer solution known as the Lightning Network was proposed in 2016 and now has several different implementations, all of which are interoperable:

- Core-lightning by Blockstream
- Eclair by Acinq
- LND by Lightning strike

This peer-to-peer network aims to facilitate micro-transactions, which are transactions of very low value that would otherwise be impractical due to high fees and long confirmation times on the Bitcoin blockchain.

### What are the use cases of the network?

This technology opens the door to a wide range of potential applications for Bitcoin that were previously out of reach due to the constraints necessary to ensure the security and decentralization of Bitcoin. Among these applications in everyday life, we can mention instant billing in commerce (both physical and online), streaming money for real-time payments, and micro-donations for content. By deploying a network of almost instant, secure, and low-cost transactions (on average less than 0.5%), many previously unimaginable business models can be implemented. This is possible because the Lightning Network uses sats (the decimal of bitcoin) to function.

The video game industry offers a particularly interesting example of how the Lightning Network can be used to transform existing business models. The concept of "skin in the game" is an idea that has recently gained popularity in this context. It essentially involves having a financial stake in the outcome of a game.
The Lightning Network allows players to wager very small amounts of money when playing games, such as a few satoshis (about a fraction of a euro cent). This allows for the establishment of a stake that stimulates competition while significantly increasing the cost of deploying bots.

In summary, the future of micro-transactions with Bitcoin looks promising thanks to innovations like the Lightning Network. As these technologies continue to develop and mature, we can expect to see new and exciting applications emerge in the near future. Take, for example, the concept of "money streaming." With the Lightning Network, we can make micro-transactions every minute (potentially without a trusted third party), which opens the door to experimenting with economic models where consumers pay for content based on what they consume.

![image](assets/en/chapter19/8.webp)

In such a system, money is automatically divided, based on a predefined percentage, among the different contributors to a service or product. This could revolutionize the way we think about payment models. For example, instead of paying a monthly subscription for a service, users could be charged per minute, or even per second, for the time they spend using the service. Such an economic model could have profound implications for content creators, who would be incentivized to produce quality content to retain users' attention. Users, in turn, would only pay for the content they consume, thus eliminating upfront subscription fees. It is even conceivable to use this system for renting goods.

In conclusion, the Lightning Network opens up a multitude of exciting use cases for Bitcoin users. The resulting economic models and business opportunities are numerous and varied.

## Red pill or blue pill?
<chapterId>c81cdb45-6aa9-5462-9835-c4852084b2cc</chapterId>

As Morpheus said to Neo: "You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed, and you believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes." Are you ready to explore the rabbit hole of Bitcoin? Be careful, as you might rediscover your financial freedom!

### Technological future and its implications

Technology is evolving exponentially, and no one can predict its future developments with certainty. The connectivity of the world and artificial intelligence continue to advance. The knowledge that an individual can acquire through the internet is becoming increasingly immeasurable over time.

Let's take AI as an example. These technologies have already surpassed or are approaching human-level performance in a growing number of domains, such as video games, image and text production, and data analysis. One potential implication is that over 80% of jobs will disappear due to AI and automation. Several options are available to us, such as restraining technological progress or harnessing the increased capital from productivity gains created by AI.

The essential questions to ask are:

- How do we manage a society where 80% of jobs will disappear?
- How do we revitalize a population?
- Is there a need for as many teachers?
- The geopolitical, political, and human consequences of automation are not sufficiently discussed.
  Computing, the internet, streaming, and VR will change education. We could have a universal course for all French students managed by the government and teachers who no longer give lectures but directly accompany the students. Children could go into a virtual world and be accompanied in learning history.

- Where is the boundary between a teacher and an AI?
- How can we guarantee a society that lives in prosperity?

These fundamental questions for our future must be debated and collectively decided. But what is the connection with Bitcoin? Like the internet for modes of communication, Bitcoin is a technological revolution for new modes of large-scale organization, bringing us the possibility of exchanging value without any trusted third party. Do we want to hinder the technological evolution of the monetary system or reap the increase in capital through the tenfold productivity gain from using Bitcoin and Lightning protocols?

### What is the future of finance?

These reflections also raise questions about who should hold, authorize, and trace the money we use. The goal is to decide between a closed system with unelected leaders or an open system without trusted third parties, where neutrality prevails.

- Is currency a form of private property?
- Can protesters' accounts be blocked without a Supreme Court order?
- Who guarantees the financial system?
- How can an individual be sovereign over their money and rely on a trusted third party?
- Can money be sent to the other side of the world without fees or intermediaries?

Accepting these new technologies could generate massive economies of scale worldwide. Should we allow the free movement of capital flows? International blockades have economic and political consequences. Is it ethical to use financial intermediaries like Western Union, which sometimes charge up to 25% in fees? We believe that in an increasingly digital world, money should be democratized and considered a common good belonging to the people rather than the state or opaque financial institutions.

The question of who should control the banking system is crucial because the rules of the banking game are not transparent and understandable to all, allowing a caste of politicians and regulators to maintain their grip on the system. It is important to question whether the free market or a group of intellectuals should control the banking system.

### Our freedoms are at stake.

The censorship must also be questioned because who has the knowledge to decide what should be censored or not? The media has changed their position on certain information and the people who were censored before are no longer censored today.

- Who decides what is censorship or propaganda?
- Who has the divine hand over our system?

Tolerating censorship can destroy freedom of expression and the right to assembly. Implementing censorship is technically difficult without creating a complete dystopia. Which entity should have the power of censorship? The question of censorship is complicated and it is difficult to know who should be censored or not. Censorship can have a negative impact on innovation and freedom to undertake.

There are 2.4 billion people in the world without a bank account, which necessarily creates geographical inequalities. Bitcoin allows for equality in transactions, regardless of your social status or political position. The Bitcoin protocol is apolitical and does not give specific privileges to the president or other actors. Leaders should have the same privileges as ordinary people to push development upwards rather than leaving some at the top and others at the bottom. Should everyone have the same currency, regardless of their social status? It is important to think about the world we want to leave to our children. We wish to leave an open world where they are free to do what they want with their money.

Bitcoin is important and should not be considered just a game of chance. It is crucial to continue asking questions about Bitcoin.

### Bitcoin: a revolutionary protocol

As we have seen in the previous chapter, the Bitcoin protocol is neutral towards all its users. Thanks to consensus rules and cryptography, we can record transactions immutably in a global public ledger, guaranteeing monetary value transfers without any trusted third party. The second-layer infrastructure (and soon the third layer, with RGB) allows for network scalability and the development of new functionalities, especially to address scaling issues.

Bitcoin has all the necessary characteristics to be an efficient and healthy currency: divisible, instantly transportable, uncensorable, negligible cost for verification, and with a monetary policy already set for centuries to come with these 21 million units. Bitcoin is pseudonymous and can be exchanged anywhere in the world without any authorization from any entity, you just need to hold your own private keys - as the saying goes "Not your keys, not your bitcoins".

Bitcoin is adopted by diverse groups of people, from cryptographers to libertarians to traditional businesses and even a country. However, Bitcoin is for everyone, and its number of users is growing, as is the number of Bitcoin nodes that serve as guardians of transaction history, ensuring its decentralization.

Bitcoin cannot be stopped anymore and cannot be censored anymore. It is a peaceful revolution to change the monetary system and enable financial inclusivity. Users can obtain bitcoins by accepting them for their trade or by buying them through regulated or unregulated platforms. Bitcoins can be stored in wallets, mobile applications, or physical devices. No trusted intermediary in Bitcoin, Bitcoin advocates transparency, freedom, and individual responsibility - as the saying goes "Don't Trust, Verify".

Changing the financial system requires changing the currency. Satoshi created Bitcoin in 2008 to propose an attempt at this. Having access to easy and "magical" money corrupts. Bitcoin is therefore an alternative to build a new neutral monetary system. Bitcoin allows for the emancipation from the banking system. It is a social phenomenon that leads us to participate in a peaceful revolution. Are you ready to join?
