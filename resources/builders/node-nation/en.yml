 Node Nation is an educational program that promotes financial sovereignty through Bitcoin among students in public schools in El Salvador. The program teaches them how to configure and manage Bitcoin and Lightning Network nodes with a technical focus.

 With a practical and technical approach, the project aims to impart knowledge about Bitcoin and decentralization through the installation and management of nodes. It is supported by the Ministry of Education, the National Bitcoin Office, and Plan B Network.

 Node Nation has an ambitious and revolutionary goal: to install 6,000 Bitcoin nodes in public schools across the country, setting an unprecedented milestone in global Bitcoin adoption. This effort not only seeks to position El Salvador as a world leader in financial sovereignty but also to train a new generation of students in the tools needed to participate in the digital revolution of the future. With each node installed, students will not only learn to master this technology but also become the custodians of the decentralized power of Bitcoin.
