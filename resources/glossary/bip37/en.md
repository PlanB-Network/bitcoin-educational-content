term: BIP37

A proposal introduced to allow lightweight wallets (*Simplified Payment Verification*) to filter transactions without having to download the entire blockchain. This method is based on the concept of Bloom Filters, probabilistic data structures used to test membership in a set. These filters enable SPV clients to only receive transactions relevant to their wallet, in order to reduce the bandwidth and RAM required for synchronization, especially on mobile phones. Bloom Filters are transmitted to a full node, which in response sends back "Merkle blocks", containing only the filtered transactions, the header with the Merkle root, and the branches necessary to link these transactions to the Merkle tree root. BIP37 has been criticized for its privacy shortcomings, as it notably exposes users' addresses and transactions to the full nodes used. To attempt to remedy this flaw, it is possible to integrate additional transactions, the "false positives", to create plausible deniability. However, the volume of false positives necessary to achieve a satisfactory level of plausible deniability remains significantly high. Furthermore, BIP37 has also been criticized for the computational burden it imposes on full nodes and for introducing a new DoS attack vector. This option is therefore disabled by default in Bitcoin Core. To enable it, the parameter `peerbloomfilters=1` must be entered in the configuration file.
