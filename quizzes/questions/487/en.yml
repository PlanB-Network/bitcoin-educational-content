question: What is the difference between a passphrase and a mnemonic phrase in a Bitcoin
  wallet?
answer: The passphrase is free and can reach an almost infinite size, while the mnemonic
  phrase is standardized and must follow certain constraints of size, checksum, and
  encoding
wrong_answers:
  - The passphrase is standardized, while the mnemonic phrase is free and can reach
    an almost infinite size
  - The passphrase and the mnemonic phrase are the same
  - The passphrase is optional, while the mnemonic phrase is mandatory
explanation: |
  To derive the keys of an HD wallet, both the mnemonic phrase and the
  passphrase are necessary. The passphrase is free and can reach an almost infinite
  size. It is not included in the mnemonic phrase, which is standardized and must
  follow certain constraints of size, checksum, and encoding.
