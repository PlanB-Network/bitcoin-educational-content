term: TAPROOT ASSETS PROTOCOL
---

Protocol developed by Lightning Labs that allows for the issuance of assets on the main Bitcoin blockchain, leveraging the Taproot update. Taproot Assets enable the creation of fungible assets like stablecoins and non-fungible assets like NFTs. Taproot Assets can be transferred via classic Bitcoin transactions or through the Lightning Network. This protocol uses *Merkle-Sum Sparse Merkle Trees* (MS-SMT), a kind of combination of MST and SMT, to ensure the validity and auditability of the assets.
