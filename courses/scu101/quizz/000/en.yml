wrong_answers:

explanation: |
  Private browsing is a feature that prevents internet browsers from storing
  browsing history, temporary internet files, form data, cookies, and user names and
  passwords. However, it does not hide browsing from your internet service provider.
  On the other hand, TOR network offers anonymity by masking the user's IP address
  and allowing access to the Darknet.
