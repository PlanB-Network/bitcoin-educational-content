term: GITLAB
---

A source code management and hosting platform that facilitates collaboration among developers. GitLab is the main alternative to GitHub. The platform is quite similar, but it also offers the possibility to be self-hosted. As its name suggests, GitLab is built on the Git version control system. This platform thus enables tracking code changes, managing versions, and fostering collaboration through tools like pull requests and issues. Some Bitcoin-related projects such as Samourai Wallet, Whirlpool, or RoninDojo use GitLab.
