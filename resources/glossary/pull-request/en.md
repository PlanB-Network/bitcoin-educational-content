term: PULL REQUEST
---

Within the context of GitHub and other code hosting platforms, a Pull Request is a request made by a contributor to integrate their changes from a branch of their fork into a branch of the main repository. It triggers a code review and discussion before the changes can potentially be merged. This process is widely used in the development of Bitcoin node implementations, notably Bitcoin Core.
