term: PHOENIXD
---

Specialized implementation of a Lightning (lightning) node, designed to send and receive payments from a server. Phoenixd uses the same software as the Phoenix mobile wallet/node, but unlike the latter, which is exclusively intended for smartphones, phoenixd is capable of running on a server as a daemon. Instead of having a graphical user interface (GUI), it is equipped with an HTTP API interface and supports automatic channel and liquidity management. Phoenixd is a project developed and maintained by the French company Acinq.
