question: What is the role of ASICs in Bitcoin mining?
answer: ASICs are machines designed solely for applying the SHA256 algorithm in the
  mining process.
wrong_answers:
  - ASICs are used to verify Bitcoin transactions.
  - ASICs are used to create new bitcoins.
  - ASICs are used to secure the Bitcoin network.
explanation: >-
  ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are specialized hardware
  designed specifically for Bitcoin mining. They are optimized to perform the SHA256
  hashing function, which is the mathematical problem that miners must solve in the
  Proof of Work.
