question: What would be the implications if the blocks were 100 times heavier?
answer: Running a Bitcoin node would not be accessible to the average person, compromising
  the decentralization of the protocol and the immutability of transactions and consensus
  rules
wrong_answers:
  - Running a Bitcoin node would be more accessible to the average person, enhancing
    the decentralization of the protocol and the immutability of transactions and
    consensus rules
  - The transaction capacity of the network would decrease
  - The block reward for miners would increase
explanation: >-
  If the blocks were 100 times heavier, running a Bitcoin node would require
  a 50TB hard disk, a bandwidth of over 500GB/month, and hardware capable of validating
  hundreds of thousands of transactions in less than 10 minutes. This would make running
  a Bitcoin node inaccessible to the average person, compromising the decentralization
  of the protocol and the immutability of transactions and consensus rules.
