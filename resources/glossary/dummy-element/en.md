term: DUMMY ELEMENT
---

Refers to an additional and unnecessary element consumed by the opcodes `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` and `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY` during the verification of signatures in a transaction. Due to a historical off-by-one bug (unit shift error), these 2 opcodes remove an extra element from the stack in addition to their basic function. To avoid an error, it is therefore mandatory to include a dummy value at the beginning of the `scriptSig` to satisfy the removal and bypass the bug. This unnecessary value is what is called the "*dummy element*". BIP11, which introduced the P2MS standard, advised using an `OP_0` as the dummy value. However, this standard was not enforced at the consensus rule level, meaning that any value could be placed there without invalidating the transaction. Thus, the dummy element was a vector for transaction malleability. BIP147, introduced with the SegWit soft fork, mandated that this dummy element be strictly an empty byte array (`OP_0`), thereby eliminating the malleability associated with this element by rendering any non-compliant transaction invalid according to consensus rules. This rule, named `NULLDUMMY`, applies to both SegWit and pre-SegWit transactions.
