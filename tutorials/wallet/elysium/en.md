Elysium Wallet is the first non-custodial software wallet from Swiss startup Elysium Labs.

Thanks to the innovative key management system, you can access your digital assets using elements that are part of everyday life: your username, passkey, password or passcode.
That's right: it is no longer strictly necessary to use a Seed Phrase to regain access to your digital assets.
This simplification could accelerate the spread of Bitcoin around the world.

## How to Open an Account?
Download the Elysium Wallet App from the Apple Store or Google Play.
Open the Elysium Wallet app that you downloaded on your device.
Tap on "Create a new wallet".
A screen with the terms and conditions of use will appear.
To accept and proceed with the creation of your account, tap on "Begin Setup".
Enter your username.
The profile image is customizable: choose one from the options provided, by taking a photo or uploading an image from your device.
When you have chosen, tap "Continue".

Elysium stands out for its innovative multi-factor algorithm, which combines Passkey, PassCode and PassWord.
PassKeys are mandatory.
They allow you to authenticate quickly and securely using your device's built-in security features, such as Face ID or fingerprint scanning.
They are your main layer of protection, ensuring fast and secure access.

Choose your second level: PassCode or PassWord
Next, you will need to choose a second level of security:

- PassCode: 6-digit code that is easy to remember. Perfect for adding an extra layer of protection.
- Password: Create a strong password of at least 8 characters, adding even more security.

You must use Passkeys in conjunction with a PassCode or PassWord.

Note: To set up your account, you need at least 2 factors, one of which must be the Passkey.

To further increase security, you can add a third layer of protection (Passkey + PassCode + PassWord).

Combination of layers for maximum security
You will always use Passkey as the primary factor. For the second layer, choose PassCode or PassWord.
If you have chosen PassCode as the second factor, you can add PassWord as the third layer or vice versa. This flexible approach ensures that your assets are protected according to your preferences.
You can add the third security factor during the setup phase (see images) or later by going to Settings > Improve security.

However, if you forget one of the factors, please note that:

If you have set up all three factors, you can always change or reset them from the settings.
Unfortunately, if you have only set up two factors and forget one, there is no recovery option.

We strongly recommend setting up all three factors from the beginning for maximum security and flexibility.
