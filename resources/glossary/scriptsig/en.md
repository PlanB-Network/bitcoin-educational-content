term: SCRIPTSIG
---

An element in a Bitcoin transaction located in the inputs. The `scriptSig` provides the necessary data to satisfy the conditions set by the `scriptPubKey` of the previous transaction from which funds are being spent. It thus plays a complementary role to the `scriptPubKey`. Typically, the `scriptSig` contains a digital signature and a public key. The signature is generated by the owner of the bitcoins using their private key and proves that they have the authorization to spend the UTXO. In this case, the `scriptSig` demonstrates that the holder of the input possesses the private key corresponding to the public key associated with the address specified in the `scriptPubKey` of the previous outgoing transaction.

When the transaction is verified, the data from the `scriptSig` are executed in the corresponding `scriptPubKey`. If the result is valid, it means that the conditions for spending the funds have been met. If all the inputs of the transaction provide a `scriptSig` that validates their `scriptPubKey`, the transaction is valid and can be added to a block for execution.

For example, here is a classic P2PKH `scriptSig`:

```text
<signature> <public key>
```

The corresponding `scriptPubKey` would be:

```text
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_PUSHBYTES_20 <address> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```
