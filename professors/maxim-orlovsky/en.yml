bio: |
  I am a transhumanist and cypherpunk performing scientific, engineering and business activities. 
  My primary focus is building foundations for the future - foundations, which will unlock the full potential of individuals, enabling self-sovereignty, privacy and censorship-resistance. This is the future of vertical progress and humanity's evolution into forms much outside of what current collectivistic society can propose or allow.
