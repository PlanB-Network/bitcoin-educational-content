term: HARDWARE WALLET
---

A hardware wallet, or physical wallet, is an electronic device dedicated to the security and management of a Bitcoin wallet's private keys. These devices are designed to provide enhanced security compared to software wallets that are on general-purpose machines and directly connected to the internet. Hardware wallets store the mnemonic phrase offline, on a device that has a very small attack surface, which isolates it from potentially vulnerable environments. When a transaction is made, the hardware wallet signs the transaction within the device itself, without exposing the private key externally. Once the transaction is signed, it is transmitted to the Bitcoin network to be confirmed and included in the Bitcoin blockchain. Among the most popular models of hardware wallets are: Ledger, Trezor, Coldcard, Passport, BitBox, Satochip, Jade, and SeedSigner (list is not exhaustive).

> ► *The term hardware wallet can be expressed in different ways in French. Some refer to it as "portefeuille matériel" or "portefeuille froid." Some bitcoiners prefer the term "périphérique de signature," or "signing device" in English, to avoid the implication that bitcoins are physically located in the wallet.*
