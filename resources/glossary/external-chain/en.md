term: EXTERNAL CHAIN
---

In the derivation of deterministic and hierarchical wallets, the external chain is a derivation branch used to generate receiving addresses intended to receive payments from outside, that is, from another wallet. Each account, as defined at depth 3, has two chains at depth 4: an external chain and an internal chain (also called "change"). The external chain is derived with an index of `/0/`. The external chain derives addresses meant to be communicated publicly, that is, the addresses that are offered to us when we click on the "receive" button in our wallet software.
