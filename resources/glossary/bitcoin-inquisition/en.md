term: BITCOIN INQUISITION
---

Bitcoin Core software fork aimed at testing the integration of new Bitcoin improvement proposals in a controlled environment on test networks like a Signet. It includes, for example, support for BIP118 (ANYPREVOUT) and BIP119 (CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY). The goal of Bitcoin Inquisition is to experiment in order to gain a better understanding of the applications, benefits, risks, and compromises related to these changes. Bitcoin Inquisition is maintained by Anthony Towns.
