# Rules 

- the nomenclature of courses is the following:
	- 3 uppercase letter to refer to a discipline (see [list of discipline](#Discipline List))
	- 3-digit number to evaluate the difficulty of the course like the university system (the delineation helps ensure appropriate skill levels match course content):
		- Courses numbered from 101 to 199 are tailored for beginners
		- Those marked from 201 to 299 cater to intermediate learners 
		- Advanced learners can delve into courses numbered from 301 to 399 
		- For developers there are specialized courses ranked from 401 to 499 . 
		- NOTE: the two last digits are mainly used to index the course but keep in mind that a course with a higher index will most likely represent a higher level of difficulty. This evaluation is left to the author of the course.
