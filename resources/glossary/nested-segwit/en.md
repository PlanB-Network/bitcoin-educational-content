term: NESTED SEGWIT
---

A script standard used to wrap native SegWit scripts within a P2SH script. Nested SegWit scripts were invented at the launch of SegWit to facilitate its adoption. They allow the use of this new standard, even with services or wallets not yet natively compatible with SegWit. It acts as a kind of transition script towards the new standard. Today, it is therefore no longer very relevant to use these types of wrapped SegWit scripts, since most wallets have implemented native SegWit.
