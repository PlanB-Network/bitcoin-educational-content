term: SMPPS

Acronym for "*Shared Maximum Pay Per Share*". It is a method for calculating the remuneration of miners within the context of mining pools. It is a variant of the PPS method. It limits payments so that the pool never pays out more than it has earned in block rewards. Thus, even if miners submit valid shares, the total reward distributed cannot exceed the pool's revenue. This method aims to maintain the financial balance of the pool while using a pay-per-task system, which helps to reduce the variance for individual miners.
