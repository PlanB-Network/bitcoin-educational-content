The BitBlockBoom! is a bitcoin conference. To put it in simple terms this conference is only for people who are interested in Bitcoin. Attendees range from people highly known and heavily involved in Bitcoin, to people who are just trying to learn what bitcoin is all about. You will not find anyone shilling shitcoins or NFTs. This is a True Bitcoin Conference. BitBlockBoom has created a wonderful atmosphere to meet and discuss bitcoin with the speakers and other bitcoiners.
