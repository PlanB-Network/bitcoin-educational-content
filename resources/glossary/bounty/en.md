Reward offered for the completion of a specific task, often related to the improvement or security of a software project. Bounties are frequently used to encourage the discovery and correction of vulnerabilities in software, to develop new features, or to solve complex problems. Participants, usually developers or researchers, receive a reward once their contributions have been verified and accepted. This incentive system helps to accelerate development and enhance the security of software by mobilizing a broader community. Bounties are sometimes used by software in the context of Bitcoin.
