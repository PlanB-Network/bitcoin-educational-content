term: MERGED MINING
---

A consensus technique for sidechains that allows Bitcoin miners to work simultaneously on the main chain and on one or more sidechains, without having to provide additional computational work. This involves reusing Bitcoin's proof of work for third-party applications. However, merged mining has a significant disadvantage for the miner: it requires the installation and execution of specific node software for each sidechain to enable the reuse of its proof of work. Moreover, the reward for mining a sidechain is paid out on that sidechain and not directly in BTC on the main blockchain.
