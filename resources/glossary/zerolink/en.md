term: ZEROLINK
---

A Chaumian coinjoin protocol that aims to break all links between separate sets of coins through advanced mixing techniques. The ZeroLink protocol is distinguished by its ability to protect user anonymity against various forms of transaction and network level chain analysis. ZeroLink introduces a framework for coinjoin wallets, with the use of pre-mix and post-mix segregated accounts, as well as a unique mixing technique: the Chaumian coinjoin. To date, the only implementation of ZeroLink coinjoins is Whirlpool, available on Samourai Wallet and Sparrow Wallet. This protocol [was introduced by nopara73 and TDevD in 2017](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/blob/master/README.md).
