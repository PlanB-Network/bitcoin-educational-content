question: How does a mining pool work and why is it necessary?
answer: A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing resources to increase their chances of mining. This cooperation is necessary because an isolated small mining machine is competing against industry giants, reducing its chances of success to a negligible level. By pooling together, miners can combine their computing power, find blocks more frequently, and then distribute the rewards proportionally to each miner's contribution to the pool.
wrong_answers:
  - A mining pool is a group of miners who share the same mining machine to increase their chances of mining. This cooperation is necessary because a single mining machine can only mine a limited amount of Bitcoin.
  - A mining pool is a group of miners who share the same mining software to increase their chances of mining. This cooperation is necessary because different mining software have different efficiencies.
  - A mining pool is a group of miners who share the same mining location to increase their chances of mining. This cooperation is necessary because the location of the mining operation can affect the efficiency of mining.
