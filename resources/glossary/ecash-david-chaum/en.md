term: ECASH (DAVID CHAUM)
---

Protocol proposed by David Chaum in 1982, which is one of the first digital currency systems designed to preserve user anonymity. It is based on public key cryptography principles to create a digital currency that can be exchanged securely and anonymously. eCash operates by creating digital tokens signed by a bank. Thus, it represents an evolution of deposit banks, without being decentralized. During transactions, these tokens are transferred between parties without revealing the users' identities, thereby preserving their privacy. eCash is considered a precursor to cryptocurrencies. It often comes up in discussions about Bitcoin, with some wanting to use systems similar to eCash as a layer on top. Today, the trend is more towards so-called "federated Chaumian" systems like Fedimint.
