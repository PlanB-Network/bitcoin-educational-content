explanation: |
  According to the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle, when there is
  a decrease in interest rates due to an increase in credit, the economy enters a
  recession; asset prices fall, real wages decline, consumer prices fall, and inventory
  piles up. This is because the decrease in interest rates leads to a misallocation
  of capital, which eventually results in a recession.
