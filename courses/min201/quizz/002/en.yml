question: What is the main difference between a CPU and an ASIC in the context of Bitcoin mining?
answer: A CPU can perform a multitude of different types of calculations without being particularly optimized for one type of calculation, whereas an ASIC can perform only one type of calculation, but very efficiently
wrong_answers:
  - A CPU is more energy-efficient than an ASIC
  - An ASIC is more versatile than a CPU
  - A CPU can perform only one type of calculation, whereas an ASIC can perform a multitude of different types of calculations
explanation: |
  ASICs are chips, comparable to a CPU chip, however, they are developed
  to perform only one specific type of calculation in the most efficient way possible.
  In other words, a CPU is capable of performing a multitude of different types of
  calculations without being particularly optimized for one type of calculation or
  another, whereas an ASIC will be able to perform only one type of calculation, but
  very efficiently.
