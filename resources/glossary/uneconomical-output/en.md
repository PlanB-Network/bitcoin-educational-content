term: UNECONOMICAL OUTPUT
---

Refers to extremely small amounts of bitcoin that are too minor to be sent in a transaction because the fees required to include them in a block would be proportionally higher than their value. The precise definition of "dust" can vary depending on the context, but it generally refers to any transaction output that requires more in fees to spend than it is worth in value. For Bitcoin users, it is important to manage their UTXOs and to practice consolidating them so that they do not become dust.
