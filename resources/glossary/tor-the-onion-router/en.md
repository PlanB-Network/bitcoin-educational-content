term: TOR (THE ONION ROUTER)
---

A network of relay servers (nodes) that anonymizes the origin of TCP connections on the internet. It operates by encapsulating data in multiple layers of encryption. Each relay node removes a layer to reveal the address of the next node, until the final destination is reached. The Tor network ensures anonymity by preventing intermediate nodes from knowing both the origin and destination of the data, making it very difficult for an observer to trace the user's activity. The TOR network can be used in the context of Bitcoin to avoid associating one's IP address with a Bitcoin node, thereby avoiding the leakage of certain personal information.
