term: VOUT
---

A specific element of a Bitcoin transaction that determines the destination of the sent funds. A transaction can include multiple outputs, each uniquely identified by the combination of the transaction identifier (`txid`) and an index called `vout`. This index, starting at `0`, marks the position of the output in the sequence of transaction outputs. Thus, the first output will be designated by `"vout": 0`, the second by `"vout": 1`, and so on.

Each `vout` primarily encapsulates two pieces of information:
* the value, expressed in bitcoins, which represents the amount sent;
* a locking script (`scriptPubKey`) that stipulates the conditions required for the funds to be spent again in a future transaction.

The combination of the `txid` and the `vout` of a specific piece forms what is called a UTXO, for example:
