## Purpose

The Bitcoin Educational Content Repo is designed to serve as a centralised hub for high-quality educational resources related to Bitcoin. Its key objectives include:

- Facilitating understanding and adoption of Bitcoin technology.
- Providing access to a wide range of educational materials, software, and hardware recommendations.
- Enabling contribution and collaboration from a diverse community of users and developers.
- Breaking down language barriers to ensure accessibility and inclusivity. For a list of supported languages, refer to the [Supported Languages](#supported-languages) section below.

## Supported Languages

Thanks to our contributors, the Plan â‚¿ Network content is available in many languages and we are able to keep adding new languages.

To see which languages are already available, just browse our [website](https://planb.network) and switch to your preferred language.

If you want to contribute to any existing content by proofreading it to improve translation quality or you want to add a missing language, please read our [Readme file](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content?tab=readme-ov-file#how-can-you-contribute) dedicated section, have a look to our [Content Translation & Proofreading Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/PlanB-Network/projects/3) and engage with us in the [Telegram Content Builder Group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised according to the following hierarchy:

- **[Courses](./course_documentation.md)**: Course content are stored here and must respect some format specification 
- **Professors**: Each professor has a profile with relevant data. You can find complete specifications about professors in the [PBN Template Repo](/PBN-template-repo/professors/) folder with examples and comments. Professors are identifiead through content by using the associated [Planâ‚¿-UID](./planb-uid.md).
- **Resources**: Five type of resources (book, builder,conference, glossary and podcast) are stored here. You can find complete specifications about each of them in the corresponding subfolder in [Template Repo](/PBN-template-repo/professors/) folder with examples and comments.
- **Scripts**: Scripts are used to perform specific action or to automate some tasks. Usually PBN staff will use them or ask contributors to use them only if needed.
- **Tutorials**: Tutorials are stored in categories and must respect some format specification
