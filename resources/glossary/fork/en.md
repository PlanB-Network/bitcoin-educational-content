term: FORK
---

The term "fork" has several meanings in the context of Bitcoin. It can refer to either a split of the network of nodes into several separate groups, leading to the creation of multiple different blockchains, or a modification of the protocol rules, or both simultaneously. To simplify, we can distinguish 4 main categories of forks:
* The natural fork: occurs when there is temporary competition between two blocks discovered at the same time at the same height. This fork can extend over several blocks. This type of fork resolves naturally when one of the chains becomes longer than the other (with more work accumulated), leading to a reorganization. This reorganization manifests with all nodes agreeing again on a single blockchain;
* The code fork: involves creating a brand new cryptocurrency from the Bitcoin source code, by launching a new blockchain from the Genesis block;
* The hard fork: represents a modification of the Bitcoin protocol, incompatible with previous versions, by removing rules or easing existing ones. This results in the creation of two distinct and incompatible chains if not all nodes are updated. The network then splits into two: those who adopt the new rules and those who retain the old ones;
* The soft fork: involves retrocompatible modifications that add rules or make existing ones more restrictive, without causing a division of the network. Nodes that do not adopt the new rules can continue to follow the same chain as others, provided that the majority of the network's computing power supports the updated chain.
