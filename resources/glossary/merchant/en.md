term: MERCHANT
---

Any natural or legal person who agrees to exchange a good or service for bitcoins. It is these merchants who give bitcoin its utility. The more a currency is accepted by a wide range of merchants, the more useful it becomes for individuals. Since merchants have the ability to determine the utility of a currency by agreeing to exchange it for goods and services, in the case of Bitcoin, they also have a significant influence on the choice of consensus rules. Each has a certain power proportional to the economic activity they can bring to a fork. Among the merchants, there are obviously businesses, but also exchange platforms, miners, and users.
