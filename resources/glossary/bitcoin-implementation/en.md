term: BITCOIN IMPLEMENTATION
---

Refers to software that applies and follows the rules defined by the Bitcoin protocol. What is generally called "Bitcoin" is the electronic money system. It is a protocol that specifies rules. It is represented, concretely, by nodes that form a network. This system does not specifically have code. It is simply a set of broad tacit rules imposed by the consensus of users through their nodes. However, those that have computer code, and can therefore be developed, maintained, and modified, are rather the Bitcoin node software. These are independent implementations of the Bitcoin protocol, which can connect to the rest of the network.

Among the Bitcoin implementations, Bitcoin Core is by far the most widespread, as it represents about 99% of the node network. However, there are also minority implementations such as BTCsuite, Bcoin, and Bitcoin Knots. Despite the diversity of software clients available, the predominance of Bitcoin Core on the network gives it an almost exclusive influence over the application of the Bitcoin protocol. Therefore, it is said that Bitcoin Core effectively represents the Bitcoin protocol itself.
