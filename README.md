If you're just lost on GitHub, visit our [website](https://planb.network) to learn more about Bitcoin.

However, we hope you're here to contribute, so here we will present the inner workings of this content management system and how you can assist us -- either by producing new material or translating/proofreading content in your language.

Thank you for your time, involvement, and effort in this project. Here, we believe in a [value-for-value model](https://dergigi.com/2021/12/30/the-freedom-of-value/) and we'll do our best to reciprocate your contribution on the basis of your Proof-of-Work. Moreover, by participating in the creation of valuable Bitcoin resources for your local community, you could also get some useful tips.

# Why do we do it?

Plan ₿ Network was born from our belief in the transformative power of Bitcoin to create a decentralized future. We are inspired by the Cypherpunk Manifesto, which emphasizes the importance of knowledge as the foundation of freedom and change. Our ultimate goal is to empower individuals all over the world with the knowledge they have been deprived of, in order to revolutionize the world.

# How does it work?

Plan ₿ Network helps communities worldwide get organized to provide better education. The platform develops the necessary tools to achieve this goal through the [online academy](https://planb.network/en/courses), the [tutorials portal](https://planb.network/en/tutorials), and the [resource portal](https://planb.network/en/resources).

First, contents are published here, in this repository, as a central public
place for Bitcoin Education. Any piece of content is specifically formatted to
facilitate data parsing and (so) rendering on websites or apps.

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized around three main directories, which are:

- `courses`, comprising all the courses about Bitcoin, Lightning, Cryptography, Mining, and so on.
- `resources`, consisting of various types of resources about Bitcoin, such as books, company info, or podcasts.
- `tutorials`, containing "how-to" articles, categorized into themes like exchange, merchant, node, privacy, and so on.

Each individual piece of content, which is a markdown file, is defined by its location in this tree structure and by its language in the name. For instance, the Italian tutorial about Nerd-Miner would have the following path:

```
./tutorials/mining/nerd-miner/it.md
```

If you want to learn more about our repo structure and content format, check out our [documentation](./docs/README.md).

Instead, if you want to have a bird-eye view of our published contents and proposals, check the below:

- [Course Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/PlanB-Network/projects/5)
- [Tutorial Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/PlanB-Network/projects/6)
- [Resources Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/PlanB-Network/projects/4)

## Incentive model: Value-4-Value

We believe in the power of Proof Of Work and how it enables a value-4-value model. In the words of one of the greatest poets of our times, DerGigi, we consider time, talent and treasure. Thus, we are commited to give back to those who enrich us with their time and talent.

In practical terms, it means that any task (content creation, peer-reviewing,
proofreading), explicited as an individual Github issue, is correlated to a
reward in sats. And when the issue is closed, the reward is sent to the contributor who completed the task.

# How can you contribute?

Bitcoin is for everyone, and so is Plan ₿ Network. This means everyone has a specific talent that can contribute to the growth of the network. Whether you are a shadowy super coder or a social media influencer, your knowledge and skills are essential to spread Bitcoin knowledge across the world.

## Be a node of the network

A first way to contribute might be to become a Plan ₿ Network Node. A node is simply a Bitcoin community that wants to move to the next step and accelerate its own local Bitcoin adoption! There is no minimum size to start with.

At Plan ₿ Network, we aim to improve the educational Bitcoin ecosystem by providing the right tools to build and educate on Bitcoin. So, by becoming a node, your community will get access to a large range of resources, services, special instructive training, and more. 

If you want your community to be a reference in the Bitcoin world, learn more about how to become a node [here](https://planb.network/en/node-network).

## Be a Bitcoin Educator

If you have created some Bitcoin educational content, whether in the form of a video, book, podcast, blog, or even an entire course, Plan ₿ Network will gladly help you spread that content across the world. To achieve this goal, we provide the necessary tools for it to be translated and shared with everyone.

As an educator, your role is crucial. In fact, without your dedication and passion, Bitcoin only remains a piece of information. Instead, we want people to understand that Bitcoin is a precious piece of knowledge that will live through generations.

To propose your content directly, you can first reach out via the
[Telegram Group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder) and then do a PR on this repo.

## Join the Translation TaskForce

The key to making education powerful is to make it accessible to everybody in the world. Not everyone speaks English, or every other language on Earth! But we are sure that together, as a network, we can make every single piece of Bitcoin educational content as open-source as the seven seas by translating it into every language.

If you are confident that you can help us translate our contents, we are eagerly looking for you! Just reach out via the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder). 

Literally EVERY LANGUAGE is needed!

### The 8-step process to add a new language on PBN

If you are enthusiastic about this initiative and you would like to help us, please add your local language to the github repo and the website. Kindly follow the following steps:
1. Join the [PBN Content Builder TG group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder) and present the languages you speak.
2. [Add the new language](https://planb.network/en/tutorials/others/add-new-language-weblate) on the Weblate app (an account on Weblate is required).
3. [Start translating the static elements](https://planb.network/en/tutorials/others/translate-front-weblate) of the website.
4. When you finish, go back to the [TG group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder) and inform us that you have completed the task to receive the reward in sats.
5. Thanks to the [LLM-Translator](https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator), we'll get the automatic translation of both the BTC101 and the SCU101 courses to benchmark the automatic translation accuracy.
6. [Start proofreading](https://planb.network/en/tutorials/others/content-review-tutorial) the BTC101 and SECU101 courses on GitHub (an account on GitHub is required) in the corresponding language.
7. After you finish and we merge the PR, we will send you the reward in sats.
8. If the automatic translation is good enough, we will automatically translate all the educational content of PBN and publish it on the website.
9. Then, anyone will be able to choose any content in that language to proofread and receive the associated reward.


# Why do we use the value-4-value PoW model?

Well, because we don’t see any other way. What is the problem with the internet nowadays? It's that we think we are getting everything for free, but, in reality, we are the product. In fact, our data is used for the benefit of others. Since we believe in the freedom to choose how we handle our data and knowledge, we ensure that everything we share, build, and contribute in this open-source model is paid for in a value-for-value fashion.

## How do we do it?

Ok, so what are we actually doing? Our first goal is to gather all the amazing content that has already been created (you can find everything on our website).

But there is a catch: we want to reach every corner of the world! For this reason, we need everyone to collaborate with their own language skills.

We can't get to all the people in Bangladesh if we don't have the content in Bengali.

Therefore, we have implemented this incentive model. First, you will get paid
per task (content creation, translation/proofreading): there is a whole payment system set in place by Asi0 -- if
you are curious about it, you will find some details in the [documentation](./docs/value-4-value-model.md). In short,
each content type has a formula based on various parameters like the number of
words, the content difficulty, and other critera, so the reward associated to each task is
defined in the assigned issue.

## How will it be in the following months?

Ok, so now you have seen our value-for-value initial model, but what's next?

It's simple: as people consume your content, they will rate it. The better the rating you get as a translator or verifier, the more translations you will receive. This is what we like to call a proof-of-work structure.

The better the quality of your work, the more translations you will get. The more value you receive, the more value we receive.

**LONG LIVE VALUE-FOR-VALUE!**

# End Goal: Anihilate language barriers for Bitcoin Education

So that's it, that's our plan to take over the world! We seek every role in every language: translators, educators, and most importantly, individuals that are eager to learn.

If you believe you are one of them, [reach out](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder). We want to collaborate!
