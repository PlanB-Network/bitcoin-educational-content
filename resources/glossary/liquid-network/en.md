term: LIQUID NETWORK
---

A Bitcoin sidechain developed by Blockstream to provide fast and confidential transactions. Unlike Bitcoin's main blockchain, Liquid uses a consensus mechanism based on a federation (a selected group of node operators, usually businesses related to Bitcoin), thereby replacing Nakamoto's consensus mechanism. This approach significantly speeds up transactions and reduces costs, while offering more advanced features. Liquid also allows for the issuance of digital assets, including tokens representing other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoins on Liquid, known as L-BTC, are tied to BTC through a two-way peg system based on a part of the federation. Participants in this federation are called "functionaries," and they can serve both as "watchmen" and as "block signers."
