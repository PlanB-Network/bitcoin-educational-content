Proposal for improvement by Josibake and Ruben Somsen that introduces Silent Payments, a method for using static Bitcoin addresses to receive payments without address reuse, interaction, and without a visible on-chain link between different payments. This technique eliminates the need to generate new, unused receiving addresses for each transaction, thereby avoiding the usual interactions in Bitcoin where the recipient must provide a new address to the payer.

In this system, the payer uses the recipient's public key and their own private key to generate a fresh address for each payment. Only the recipient, with their private key, can compute the private key corresponding to this address. ECDH (*Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman*), a cryptographic key exchange algorithm, is used to establish a shared secret which is then used to derive the receiving address and private key (on the recipient's side only). To identify the Silent Payments intended for them, recipients must scan the blockchain and examine each transaction matching the criteria for Silent Payments. Unlike BIP47, which uses a notification transaction to establish the payment channel, Silent Payments eliminate this step, saving a transaction. However, the trade-off is that the recipient must scan all potential transactions to determine, by applying ECDH, if they are addressed to them.
