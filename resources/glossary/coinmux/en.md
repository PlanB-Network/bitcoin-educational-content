term: COINMUX

Implementation of coinjoin developed in 2014. Coinmux is a bitcoin mixing protocol that relies on mutual trust among participants, without requiring the intervention of a central actor. The software combines bitcoins from multiple users into a single transaction, where each output has identical amounts, thereby breaking the links between the inputs and outputs. The Coinmux protocol ensures that users retain control of their funds throughout the process, by only having transactions signed when the inputs and outputs exactly match what was agreed upon. Today, this protocol is no longer in use.
