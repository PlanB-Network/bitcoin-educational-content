term: ECONOMIC MAJORITY
---

Refers to the largest proportion of economic activity related to the bitcoin currency, generated by merchants. A merchant is defined as any physical or legal entity willing to exchange a good or service for BTC. These merchants, which include businesses, users, exchange platforms, and miners, vary in size and economic influence. Some are major players, generating substantial economic activity, while others are more modest. The economic majority is thus defined by those whose combined economic activity represents the predominant share in this currency. This majority has an influence on the consensus rules, especially in the event of a fork.
