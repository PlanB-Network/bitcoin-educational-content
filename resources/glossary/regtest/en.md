term: REGTEST
---

Private test environment for Bitcoin that allows developers to create a local Bitcoin network with custom rules. Unlike the testnet, a regtest is private, meaning it is not possible to freely connect to it. Also, it offers full control over the network settings. It notably allows for rapid block mining and the testing of specific scenarios. It is used for development, debugging, and experimentation before implementation on the testnet or mainnet. The bitcoins circulating on a regtest have no value.

> ► *Regtest is a contraction of "Regression" and "Test". In English, it could be translated as "Regression Test".*
