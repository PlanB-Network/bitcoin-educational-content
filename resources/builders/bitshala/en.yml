  Bitshala is a grassroots, community-driven educational initiative (a pathshala) led by Indian bitcoin enthusiasts, designed to guide and support new developers as they embark on their Bitcoin journey.

  While numerous courses out there offer superficial lessons on EVM and “smart contracts,” Bitcoin development requires a much deeper and broader understanding of various technical fields.

  Bitcoin is a multidisciplinary subject that encompasses Software Engineering, System Engineering, Networking Protocol Design, Game Theory, Cryptography, Economics, and the Social Dynamics of Complex Systems like markets. Due to this complexity, creating a fully comprehensive Bitcoin course is nearly impossible, and existing academic programs or coding boot camps fall short of addressing these needs. As a result, newcomers to Bitcoin development often find themselves navigating a vast array of loosely organized resources scattered across the internet.

  Bitshala seeks to fill this gap by fostering the creation, curation, and publication of diverse open-source content that meets the unique learning needs of aspiring Bitcoin developers.
