term: BLOCKSIZE WAR
---

Refers to a period of intense debate and conflict within the Bitcoin community between 2015 and 2017. This conflict centered on whether the block size, which had been limited to 1 megabyte since 2010 by Satoshi Nakamoto, should be increased to allow Bitcoin to process more transactions per block, thereby improving scalability.

Proponents of increasing the block size (known as "*big blockers*"), led by early developers such as Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen, and Mike Hearn, influential figures in the ecosystem like Roger Ver, as well as a significant portion of the major mining companies, argued that this increase was necessary to reduce transaction fees and enhance Bitcoin's scalability. They believed that this change could be made without compromising the system's security. On the other hand, opponents of the block size increase (referred to as "*small blockers*"), mainly Bitcoin Core developers (Pieter Wuille, Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, Wladimir van der Laan, Luke Dashjr...) and a part of the technical community, contended that this modification would centralize the system due to the increased operational load on nodes. They highlighted second-layer scalability solutions, such as the Lightning Network, which would support a large volume of transactions without needing to alter the base protocol.

The debate over Bitcoin's scalability approach has been ongoing since at least 2010, with the first attempt to increase the block size in October of that year through [a patch proposed by Jeff Garzik](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0). However, it was during the Blocksize War period between 2015 and 2017 that conflicts were most fierce, with several attempts at forks (Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, SegWit, SegWit2X, and Bitcoin Cash), strategies of propaganda and influence, as well as personal attacks. The abandonment of the hard fork SegWit2X on November 8, 2017, following massive opposition from the community ("NO2X"), is often seen as the event marking the end of the Blocksize War, while the casus belli is sometimes considered to be the update 0.11A of the Bitcoin XT client, which implemented BIP101 on August 15, 2015. It could also be argued that the Blocksize War ended on August 24, 2017, the date on which the soft fork SegWit was activated following the campaign in favor of the "UASF".
In English, we generally refer to the "Blocksize War" as a proper noun. Some may occasionally translate this term as "block war" or "block size war."
