term: MIT X11
---

A very permissive free software license that allows users to copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell the software. It only requires that the original license and copyright notices are retained in all substantial copies or distributions of the software. Unlike the GPL license, the MIT license does not require that adaptations or derivative versions of the software be distributed under the same license. This flexibility makes the MIT X11 license a popular choice for many open-source projects, including in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Satoshi Nakamoto chose this license for the first version of Bitcoin released in 2009, and it remains in use for the Bitcoin Core project today.
