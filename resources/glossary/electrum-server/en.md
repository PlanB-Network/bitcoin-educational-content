term: ELECTRUM SERVER
---

An indexer implemented on a full Bitcoin node that allows Electrum wallet software (or any other wallet that supports it) to operate without downloading the entire Bitcoin blockchain. An Electrum Server maintains a complete index of Bitcoin addresses and transactions, enabling quick queries from other software. To simplify, an Electrum Server acts as a kind of bridge between wallet software and a Bitcoin node that holds the blockchain.
