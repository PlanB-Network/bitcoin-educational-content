explanation: |
  Time preference is the subjective evaluation of the value of future goods
  compared to present goods. Since we are mortal, and the future is always uncertain,
  we naturally prefer to have access to a good now rather than later. While time preference
  can differ between individuals, due to a myriad of factors such as culture, wealth,
  education, physiology, etc., time preferences are always positive, meaning that
  all things equal, we always value present goods more than future goods.
