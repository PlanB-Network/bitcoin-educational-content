term: OUTBOUND PEER
---

A node to which your own Bitcoin node actively establishes a connection. By default, a node attempts to connect to 8 outbound peers. These connections are privileged and considered more reliable than inbound peers, as they are chosen by the node. Inbound and outbound peers share the same type of information. The main difference between inbound and outbound peers lies not in the type of information exchanged, but in the way these connections are established.

> ► *The English translation of "pair sortant" is "outbound peer" or "outgoing connection".*
