# Introduction 

As one of the main missions of the PlanB Network Content repo is to lower down the language barrier for Bitcoin Education, we have a strong emphasis on translating virtually all of the hosted educational content. Because we now lived in an new era of AI, thanks to the emergence of Large Lanaguage Model (LLM), and because the volume of contents that need to be translated is considerable, we believe that using a Human x AI approach would make the translation process way more faster, economically efficient and effective. To attain this goal that we are using several strategies. Currently we use the following approach: 
- [LLM-translator](#LLM-Translator approach): python-program that batch translate any `.md` or `.txt` files while keeping the document formatting
- [Transleet](#Transleet approach): a recently developed web software that is mainly used for translating entire books effortlessly

If you have another approach that seems relevant, feel free to post an [issue](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content/issues/new) to discuss about it.
