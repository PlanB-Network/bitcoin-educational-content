term: PSEUDO-RANDOM
---

This adjective is used to describe a sequence of numbers that, although being the result of a deterministic process, displays characteristics that are close to those of an ideal truly random sequence. The concept of ideal randomness implies a total absence of predictability and correlation between successive elements. A pseudo-random number is generated by a deterministic algorithm and therefore, in theory, is entirely predictable if one knows the initial state of the generator.

A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is an algorithm used to produce such numbers. It generally starts from an initial value, or "seed," and then applies a series of mathematical transformations to produce the sequence of numbers. Due to this determinability, it is important for cryptographic security that the initial seed remains secret. Pseudo-random sequences are widely used in various fields, including cryptography, as they exhibit seemingly random behavior that suffices for many applications. The evaluation of a PRNG's quality is based on the extent to which its output approaches true randomness in terms of distribution, correlations, and other statistical properties. In the context of Bitcoin, pseudo-random numbers are used to produce private keys, or to generate a seed for deterministic and hierarchical wallets.
