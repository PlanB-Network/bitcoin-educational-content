# Research

Based on the regular university functionning, it's important to have an active research.

The research is a way to find new theory and results. It's also a way to be listening and accepted by academic research.
A goal could be to provide scientific articles about Bitcoin and maybe create a laboratory associated with sovereign university which would be focus on Bitcoin theory : economic, cryptography, programming, energy, etc.



## Proposals

It's a place where you can submit your research ideas and proposal.
We want to have an academic level proposal.

If you are not researcher or student in master degree, feel free to contact the team. 
You can submit what you have written and we can talk with you to improve your proposal to raise in an academic level.

The goal is to create high level proposals but open to anyone with a good idea about academic research. 

### Requirements 

A Latex file with a bibliography accessible via a `.bib` file.

Try to be as academic as possible for your submission. Avoid as much as possible to use external link, website, etc, to prefer scientific articles. 

To find scientific articles you have : [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), [JSTOR Home](https://www.jstor.org/), [ScienceDirect.com | Science, health and medical journals, full text articles and books.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/), and others. 

In general cryptographic articles are available online for free but not everytime.
Consider to use [Sci-Hub: access to information is a human right](https://www.sci-hub.ru/) with a VPN if you need to access one unavailable article.


## Articles

You have written an article and you want to share with us ?

Feel free to deposit your article in Articles folder with a github pull request or send an email to : ....@decouvrebitcoin.com

Your article should be written in LaTeX with regular scientific standard packages. If you can try to provide your bibliography as a separate file, in format you want.
