  The Cantillon Effect, named after 18th-century economist Richard Cantillon,
  describes how the distribution of new money in an economy can lead to wealth disparities.
  Those closest to the source of the new money (such as bankers and asset owners)
  benefit first and most significantly, while those further away (such as average
  workers and savers) see less benefit or even negative effects due to inflation.
