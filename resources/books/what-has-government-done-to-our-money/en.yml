  What Has Government Done To Our Money by Murray Rothbard is a classic book that delves into the history of money and the role of government in its development. It provides a critical analysis of the central banking system and the impact of monetary policy on the economy, arguing that government intervention has caused inflation, economic instability, and a devaluation of currency. Rothbard's writing is thought-provoking and presents an alternative perspective on the nature of money and the role of government in managing the economy. This book is recommended for those interested in economics, finance, and banking, and anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between money and government policy.
