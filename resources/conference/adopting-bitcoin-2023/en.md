This talk will examine the phases of Bitcoin evangelism, talk about historical evangelism in a broad context, define subcultures, and make recommendations on who to approach and how to approach them. This will be more focused on Bitcoiners in years 4+ of their journey who have burned out talking to people they know, and who want to find people ready to receive the message. Focus: finding meaning, rejecting false prophets, and understanding how to craft virality and social change in a post-state future.

## The Day After: Envisioning Stark Realities 

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnZrkl9ZhqM&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj_tDxuQvowBnXs1-xliBJsE&index=9)

Speaker: Bill Stebbins

Many view bitcoin as a means of impregnable wealth preservation untouchable by state authorities and bypassing the need for “trusted” third party intermediation; a store-of-wealth “safe room” or “escape capsule” where one’s generational wealth can survive disruptive societal events from war to economic depression. Theoretically, bitcoin as an untouchable entity in cyberspace sanctuary could serve in this capacity, but applied within the thoroughly-considered context of such an event, could it function as anticipated? It can certainly protect wealth in instances of limited conflicts where, for example, refugees exfiltrate a troubled region, seed phrases in mind, and reconnect with their stack upon reaching safe jurisdiction. But what about larger global disruptions such as world war, nuclear war, or an extensive global fiat meltdown?

## Operation Bitcoin

Speaker: Rudy, Eliazar

“Lago Bitcoin (Bitcoin Lake) is regarded as one of the most successful Bitcoin adoption projects in the world.” Bitcoin Lake is a project located in the highlands of Guatemala. We have quickly become a highly recommended destination for Bitcoiners from around the world to come and see our focus on Bitcoin education, Orange pilling local businesses, and Bitcoin mining as a means to change the economic incentives associated with trash disposal with a portion of the proceeds going back into the community. This is our story of how it happened and how it is going. We will discuss our initial strategy for education and orange pilling business and how the realities on the ground changed our approach. We will discuss the challenges of building in a bear market and how this affected our Bitcoin mining initiative. We will also provide metrics of how the project has grown regarding bitcoin spent in the community since inception.

Speaker: Micael Margiotta

I want to present my new book in which i talk about the roots of our financial system. I tell the story of the US funding fathers and the war with the central bankers. I also explain how the fiat system works and why do we need bitcoin. I explain the dangers of falling into a surveillance state of CBDCs and social credit systems and how the Bitcoin network can help us to protects our natural rights. (Such as private property rights and free speach).

## The Dollar Endgame 

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flk79rMHwMQ&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj9TwyrCB9VbdnGcTYXCf5_y&index=6)

Speaker: Peruvian Bull

The central banks are at a crossroads. After decades of zero bound interest rates and Quantitative Easing, debt levels domestically and worldwide have reached critical levels. As the money printing bonanza of 2020 comes home to roost, dark feedback loops lurk under the waters of our economy, foreboding of a future of extreme inflation and financial devastation. The Ships of State, unmoored from the tethers of hard money and taxation, have wandered into a debt-fueled maelstrom that threatens to destroy the very currencies we base our lives on. We are now entering a place from which few fiat monies have ever returned from alive.
The Federal Reserve, the hegemon that runs the dollar-based global monetary system, is trapped in a black hole of it's own design. They believe they can save themselves, and the system. The terrifying truth is that we are not close to the event horizon- we're already past it. Only hard choices lie ahead. The Dollar Endgame approaches.

Speaker: Adam Gibson

The main stage presentation (at 1330 earlier in the afternoon) focused on what could be achieved in terms of trustless offline and offchain transactions using this "pathcoin" construct, leveraging MuSig+Schnorr with covenants.
This second session actually explains how it works in detail in terms of Bitcoin Script and signature adaptors. This proper understanding will actually allow you to see (a) the true limitations and true potential of this design, and (b) hopefully inspire you to find ways to make it, or something similar, work better!

## Finance, in a Bitcoin Economy 

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGIEH4g9NU&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj8UhC2BNE-t5p2bgDabtqp4)

Speaker: Asher Hopp

The golden age of Bitcoin-denominated securities exchanges from 2011-2015 is an often overlooked, and controversial, part of our history. Prominent Bitcoin-denominated securities exchanges such as MPEx, GLBSE, Havelock, and BTCTC promised a future where entrepreneurs could raise capital in Bitcoin rather than dollars, and investors would be repaid in Bitcoin dividends. Ultimately these exchanges failed to deliver on their promise, but does that mean that the entire idea of Bitcoin-denominated capital formation should be abandoned?

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO2fFoJ64gs&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj8UhC2BNE-t5p2bgDabtqp4&index=4)

Speaker: Kaloudis, Burtey, Hoenisch 

What is it like to build a mobile Lightning wallet in 2023?
Node implementations are more mature and stable and easy-to-use libraries exist.
However, releasing a new mobile Lightning wallet is not always a "breez", appstores might prevent developers from publishing their app and on-boarding new users has its own challenges.
In this panel we discuss the state of the art of wallet development in 2023 and share experience from leading wallet developers in this space.

## Bootstrapping Bitcoin Development in El Salvador 

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO2fFoJ64gs&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj8UhC2BNE-t5p2bgDabtqp4&index=7)

Speaker: Ajelex, Rodrigo, Quezada, Villalobos 

To accelerate Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, the Bitcoin Office and Fulgur Ventures collaborated to create Cubo+, a program designed to educate both young and experienced Salvadoran developers. The aim is to equip them with the knowledge and skills required to actively contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Cubo+ brings together educators from around the world to mentor and train a new wave of Salvadoran Bitcoin developers. After an extensive selection process, 21 students were chosen from hundreds of applicants to embark on their journey in Bitcoin development. Their initiation began with online classes to ensure a strong foundation, culminating in an intensive one-month Bootcamp in July in El Salvador. During this Bootcamp, international teachers flew in to provide in-person instruction, resulting in the successful graduation of students equipped with the essential skills to actively engage in Bitcoin ecosystem projects.

## Smart Bitcoin is here - The Power of Miniscript

## Does Bitcoin Need Covenants? 

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO2fFoJ64gs&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj8UhC2BNE-t5p2bgDabtqp4&index=9)

Speaker: Brandon Black 

The future of bitcoin is bright because bitcoin is for everyone. If only that were true. As it stands (even with the lightning network) bitcoin is for about 100 million people. With covenants bitcoin will truly be for everyone.

## Is Bitcoin decentralized enough?  

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO2fFoJ64gs&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj8UhC2BNE-t5p2bgDabtqp4&index=10)

Speaker: Zucco, Atack, Pouliot 

Bitcoin's unique properties are thanks to its decentralized nature. The nodes - miners - development triangle is decentralized, but are these areas decentralized themselves? How much decentralization is necessary in each? While any pleb can run a node and StratumV2 is around the corner to mitigate mining centralization, what, if any, improvements are necessary to preempt centralization in Bitcoin Core development? A critical look at Bitcoin's fundamentals.

## Bitcoin Offshoring - Be Your Own Offshore Bank 

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO2fFoJ64gs&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj8UhC2BNE-t5p2bgDabtqp4&index=11)

Speaker: Dr. Ulrich Eder 

Offshoring Bitcoin may sound counterintuitive, but given the state of surveillance, prohibition, excessive taxation and sanctions, it is of great importance.

## Standard of Contract: The Fourth Function of Money 

![video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO2fFoJ64gs&list=PLN2-dhqIYoj8UhC2BNE-t5p2bgDabtqp4&index=12)

Speaker: Dirac Delta 

The three function model of money is store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account, plus the meme that monetization goes in that order. However, prior to this perspective, William Jevons, one of the three men behind the marginal revolution in economics, wrote in 1875 about the four primary monetary functions: what is now called unit of account comprised both measure and standard of value. Money is the tool that emerged to solve the double coincidence of wants problem, but it also solves the double coincidence of future wants problem, and in this regard, bitcoin's adoption is not only near zero, it is actually where volatility concerns are logical. However, just like an individual can have a fraction of their holdings in bitcoin, unlike medium of exchange where it would be nonsensical, tools will emerge that enable fractional value standards across a variety of contracts, and the global use of the bitcoin standard will finally get off zero.

Speaker: Hubertus Hofkirchner 

Today we have a highly fragile banking system: fiat-based, loosely limited by fractional reserve requirements, heavily regulated and subject to government interventionism. It is a house of cards where even second tier banks are considered system-relevant and require bailouts. Recent advances on the legal and technical fronts allow us to think about a radically different system: a Bitcoin-based full reserve banking system under standard commercial law and strictly separated from the state.

Speaker: Adam Gibson 

The dream: to be able to pay someone bitcoin without any connection to them, or others, or to the bitcoin network. You want to literally pay someone by handing over a piece of paper, or a usb stick. Opendime did this with a hardware anti-tamper feature, but let's say we never trust hardware. Can we do it? PathCoin is a way to do it in a very limited way. With a small not-too-technical demonstration and explanation, I hope you will be inspired to think about it more deeply, and engineers and other thinkers can come to the deep dive investigation later in the afternoon.

Speaking: Reyna Chicas

AB 2022 had a shift on my mind about the Bitcoin movement happening in El Salvador, I decided to participate and get involved more in Bitcoin education because I recognized that my country had a unique opportunity and I wanted to see more Salvadorans involved in the process. I knew I had to do my part and share more, do more and so I would also like to explain how even though, I thought I didn't have any skills I could help with, still, I was able to use some of my "fiat world jobs" experience and with fear and everything it has helped me to become a bitcoin educator, to say yes to go to Lago Bitcoin in Guatemala and be the first international teacher from MPB El Salvador. To now also be part of the board of directors to help impulse bitcoin education in my own country and empower more Salvadoreans to do so.

## I came for Democracy but stayed for Bitcoin

Speaker: Carliño, Ed

Digital Witness, a loose translation from what is known in Guatemala as FiscalDigital.net, is a crowdsourced verification of the Guatemalan voting system through a CAPTCHA-like OCR game. It leverages on-chain Bitcoin through the Open Timestamps (OTS) protocol and the lightning network via earned rewards through Stakwork. Thousands of n00bs, mostly in Guatemala, created millions of data points that can be cryptographically linked back to official elections documents. In this way, an independent citizen audit was run by the educational non-profit FundacionHCG.org to confirm whether the elected authorities awarded the correct winners in an election with over 25 million votes cast. Instead of trusting the elections authorities, together we verify every vote. Perhaps a new generation of bitcoiner can be born, one that came for the democracy…but stayed for Bitcoin.
