term: STRATUM
---

A network protocol layered on top of Bitcoin specifically designed to optimize communication between individual miners and mining pool servers to increase their profitability. Stratum was announced in late 2011 by Marek Palatinus, better known by the pseudonym "Slush" and the founder of the very first mining pool, Slush Pool, now renamed Braiins. Stratum came to replace the older Getwork protocol, which had become obsolete.

It is important to understand that Stratum is not integrated as a rule within Bitcoin, but is rather a specific software used by pools. Although mining pools are free not to use it, Stratum has established itself as the standard for Bitcoin mining for over ten years. Its second version, Stratum V2, is currently under development. It aims to perfect Stratum and to reduce the centralization concerns associated with mining pools that the latter has generated.
