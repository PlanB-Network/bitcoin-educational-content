Acronym for "Satoshi Labs Improvement Proposals". It is a set of proposals aimed at improving or standardizing the use of Bitcoin, originating from SatoshiLabs, the company behind the Trezor hardware wallets. These proposals often act as extensions to BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals), with the goal of enriching the existing standards. They detail the technical decisions made by SatoshiLabs that do not fit within the BIPs, but which remain relevant for other software wallet or hardware wallet developers, especially in contributing to the standardization of processes.
