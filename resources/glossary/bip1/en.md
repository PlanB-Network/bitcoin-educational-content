term: BIP1

Document that defines the process for developing and implementing proposed improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. Written by Amir Taaki in August 2011, it establishes a standard methodology for proposing and documenting potential modifications. BIP proposals are then classified into three categories:
* *Standards Track*: those that concern direct modifications to the Bitcoin protocol and its interoperability;
* *Informational*: those that provide general information but do not directly affect the protocol;
* *Process*: those that introduce non-technical changes, such as procedures and guidelines.

This framework systematizes the development of Bitcoin, to ensure a coordinated and transparent approach to its evolution. The methodology of BIP1 would later be replaced by that of BIP2.
