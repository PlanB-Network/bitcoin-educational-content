term: CUSTODY
---

In the context of Bitcoin, refers to the holding and management of private keys that enable control over bitcoins. BTC custody can be ensured in two ways: either personally by the user, who keeps the necessary private keys to access their bitcoins (known as "self-custody"), or by a third party, such as an exchange platform, where the company holds the private keys and manages the bitcoins on behalf of the user. The latter option is riskier than self-custody, as it exposes the user's funds to the risks of hacking, bankruptcy, or fraudulent behavior by the manager.
