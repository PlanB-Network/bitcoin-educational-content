term: BIT
---

The word "bit" is a contraction of the terms "binary" and "digit" in English. In the context of computing and cryptology, a bit is the fundamental unit of digital information and represents the smallest possible amount of information. A bit can only take two distinct values: `0` or `1`. These values are also called binary states and can represent various things, such as the answers `yes` or `no`, `true` or `false`, and `on` or `off`. Bits are the foundation of digital systems and are used to store and transmit information in computers and networks. The name "Bitcoin" likely comes from the concatenation of the term "Bit", to evoke the electronic nature of the payment system, and the term "Coin", to suggest its monetary purpose.
