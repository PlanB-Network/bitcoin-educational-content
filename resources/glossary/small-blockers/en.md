term: SMALL BLOCKERS
---

Name given to the supporters of maintaining or moderately increasing the size of Bitcoin blocks during the Blocksize War between 2015 and 2017, in order to preserve the decentralization and security of the system. They advocate for solutions like SegWit, believe that scaling should occur on higher layers such as the Lightning Network, and support the implementation of upgrades through soft forks rather than hard forks.
