term: RUNES
---

Protocol developed by the same team as Ordinals that enables the use of Bitcoin transactions to engrave, mint, and transfer fungible digital assets other than BTC. Unlike Ordinal inscriptions, where each unit is unique, each rune is identical to the others, and therefore interchangeable, allowing for the creation of fungible cryptocurrencies different from BTC on Bitcoin. The messages of the Rune protocol, called runestones, are stored in `OP_RETURN`.
