term: PREMIUM
---

An additional amount paid over the standard or nominal price of an asset. In the context of Bitcoin, a premium can be observed when making purchases, especially on exchange platforms, which may sometimes use this technique to make their margins on the brokerage service.

This notion of premium can also be found in peer-to-peer BTC purchases. Indeed, buying non-KYC bitcoins often comes with a premium compared to the standard market price, which can vary from 1% to sometimes more than 10%. Several reasons explain this price difference. First, it is a common practice among P2P sellers that has been established over time. Next, sellers have transaction fees associated with sending funds to the buyer. There is also an increased risk of theft in P2P sales compared to transactions on regulated platforms, which justifies compensation for the risk taken. Finally, the surcharge can be related to the demand and the quality of the exchange in terms of confidentiality. As a buyer, the gain in confidentiality has a price that is reflected in the markup applied by the seller. Some bitcoiners also believe that the higher price of BTC bought in P2P reflects its true value, and argue that the lower prices on regulated platforms are the result of a compromise on the confidentiality of your personal data.
