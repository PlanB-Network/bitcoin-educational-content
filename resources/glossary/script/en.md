term: SCRIPT
---

A stack-based programming language used to establish spending conditions, and thus, indirectly secure bitcoins. Script is essentially a list of instructions, composed of logical operators and commands to manipulate stacks. It is materialized through the use of opcodes which give specific instructions that are executed by nodes to verify the validity of a transaction. Script is a non-Turing complete language. It can be categorized as an intermediate-level language (almost low-level) inspired by Forth.
