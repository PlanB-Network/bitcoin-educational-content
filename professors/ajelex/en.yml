  Passionate about Bitcoin and mining, I accompany DiscoverBitcoin in their educational mission in El Salvador and around the world. Through my journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I discovered a particular passion for mining and the concept of Home Miner. It's with this in mind that I launched, in parallel, the Attakai Explorer project at MIN201.
