Bitcoin wallet founded in November 2011 by Thomas Voegtlin, which allows users to manage their funds without downloading the entire blockchain thanks to an SPV (*Simplified Payment Verification*) system. Due to its existence since the early 2010s and its involvement in the development of Bitcoin, Electrum holds a historic place as wallet software.
