term: PROPAGATION

The process by which information, such as transactions and blocks, is transmitted from node to node across the Bitcoin network. When a user makes a transaction, it is first verified by the node to which they are connected. After validation, this transaction is relayed to other nodes connected to it, which in turn verify it and then disseminate it. Quickly, a large portion of the network's nodes will be aware of the transaction. If it offers sufficient fees, miners will include it in their candidate block. When a block containing this transaction is validated, it is then confirmed.
