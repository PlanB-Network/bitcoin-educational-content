term: ORDINALS THEORY
---

An external protocol to Bitcoin that assigns serial numbers to sats (the smallest unit of bitcoin), which allows them to be individually tracked and transferred via Bitcoin transactions. According to the Ordinals Theory, each sat is numbered in the order it was mined and is transferred on a FIFO (*First-In-First-Out*) basis. The goal of this theory is to make sats non-fungible according to their interpretation within the Ordinals protocol, in order to associate them with external information such as images (NFTs) referred to as "inscriptions".
