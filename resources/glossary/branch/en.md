term: BRANCH
---

Within the context of Git, represents a separation from the main workflow, allowing for parallel development without affecting the main branch (usually named `master` or `main`). Branches enable modifications, testing, and experimentation in an isolated environment, before their potential integration into the main project via a merge.
