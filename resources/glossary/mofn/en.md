term: M-OF-N

Refers to a threshold multisignature wallet or script. To enhance the security of bitcoins, a threshold multisignature system can be used which requires that `m` out of `n` signatures be made to spend the funds. In an m-of-n, the letter `m` designates the required signature threshold and the letter `n` indicates the total number of existing keys that can sign. For example, in a 2-of-3 configuration, two out of three possible signatures are needed to execute a transaction.
