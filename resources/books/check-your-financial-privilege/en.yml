  Check Your Financial Privilege" by Alex Gladstein is a book that explores the intersection of Bitcoin, human rights, financial privilege, and personal freedom. With a unique perspective, Gladstein highlights the inequalities in financial systems worldwide and how they impact individuals' lives. He emphasizes that being born into a reserve currency grants financial privilege, while the majority of the global population faces weaker systems.
  The book features real-life stories from different parts of the world. In Nigeria, Bitcoin has become a lifeline for human rights activists in the face of authoritarian regimes. In Cuba, Bitcoin has helped individuals navigate a devalued currency system. In El Salvador, Bitcoin offers hope by reducing remittance fees and enabling faster transactions, especially now that it has become legal tender.
  As the CSO of the Human Rights Foundation, Gladstein draws on his unique position to provide insights into the transformative power of Bitcoin for individuals outside the traditional financial systems. For many people worldwide, Bitcoin offers an escape from inflation, political turmoil, and outdated monetary systems. In some cases, it can even be a matter of life and death.
  It's important to note that proceeds from the sale of this book go towards supporting the Human Rights Foundation, underscoring the author's commitment to promoting human rights and financial inclusivity.
