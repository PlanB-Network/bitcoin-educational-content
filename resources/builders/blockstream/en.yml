  Blockstream's mission is to create the financial infrastructure of the future. 

  We build crypto-financial infrastructure based on Bitcoin, the most robust and secure blockchain. Applying cutting-edge cryptography and security engineering, we're building the technology that makes financial markets more efficient by reducing reliance on trust. With a long-term outlook on delivering robust and scalable solutions, we invest heavily in research and development to strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem and protocol.

  Peer-to-peer, open-network finance holds the promise to change the world for the benefit of all. Blockstream is proud to be making this a reality.
