term: XOR
---

Acronym for the operation "Exclusive or," in French "Ou exclusif." It is a fundamental function of Boolean logic. This operation takes two Boolean operands, each being $true$ or $false$, and produces a $true$ output only when the two operands differ. In other words, the output of the XOR operation is $true$ if exactly one (but not both) of the operands is $true$. For example, the XOR operation between $1$ and $0$ will result in $1$. We note:

$$
1 \oplus 0 = 1
$$

Similarly, the XOR operation can be performed on longer sequences of bits. For example:

$$
10110 \oplus 01110 = 11000
$$

Each bit in the sequence is compared to its counterpart, and the XOR operation is applied. Here is the truth table for the XOR operation:

| $A$ | $B$ | $A \oplus B$ |
|:---:|:---:|:------------:|
| $0$ | $0$ |      $0$     |
| $0$ | $1$ |      $1$     |
| $1$ | $0$ |      $1$     |
| $1$ | $1$ |      $0$     |

The XOR operation is used in many areas of computer science, notably in cryptography, for its interesting attributes such as:
* Its commutativity: the order of the operands does not affect the result. For two given variables $D$ and $E$: $D \oplus E = E \oplus D$;
* Its associativity: the grouping of operands does not affect the result. For three given variables $A$, $B$, and $C$: $(A \oplus B) \oplus C = A \oplus (B \oplus C)$;
* It has a neutral element $0$: an operand xored with $0$ will always be equal to the operand. For a given variable $A$: $A \oplus 0 = A$;
* Each element is its own inverse. For a given variable $A$: $A \oplus A = 0$.

In the context of Bitcoin, the XOR operation is obviously used in many places. For example, XOR is massively used in the SHA256 function, which is widely used in the Bitcoin protocol. Some protocols like Coldcard's *SeedXOR* also use this primitive for other applications. It is also found in BIP47 to encrypt the reusable payment code during its transmission.
In the broader field of cryptography, XOR can be used as is as a symmetric encryption algorithm. This algorithm is called the "One-Time Pad" or the "Vernam Cipher," named after its inventor. Although impractical due to the length of the key, this algorithm is one of the only encryption algorithms recognized as unconditionally secure.
