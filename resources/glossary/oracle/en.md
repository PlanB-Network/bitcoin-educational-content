term: ORACLE

A third-party information source that provides real-world data that can be interpreted on Bitcoin. Oracles enable smart contracts, such as DLCs, to execute contractual conditions based on external events. Generally, they provide a specific signature that matches the outcome of an event. This signature is then used to complete and validate an execution transaction that sends bitcoins to the party supposed to receive them according to the smart contract's conditions.
