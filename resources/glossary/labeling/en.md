term: LABELING
---

The practice of assigning an annotation or label to a specific UTXO in a Bitcoin wallet. For example, if I have a UTXO from a P2P purchase on Bisq with Charles, I might label it as "`Non-KYC Bisq Charles`".

Labeling is a good practice that helps to remember the origin or intended destination of a UTXO, thereby facilitating fund management and privacy optimization. Labeling becomes even more important when used with coin control. Indeed, by allowing users to differentiate and precisely select UTXOs for their transactions, this practice helps to avoid merging UTXOs from different sources. This limits the risks associated with the Common Input Ownership Heuristic (CIOH), which can reveal the common ownership of the inputs in a transaction.
