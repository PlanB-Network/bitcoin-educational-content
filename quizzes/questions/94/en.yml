question: What is the risk of using a level 3 wallet?
answer: You need to backup both the list of 12 or 24 words and your passphrase
wrong_answers:
  - You need to backup only the list of 12 or 24 words
  - You need to backup only your passphrase
  - You need to backup neither the list of 12 or 24 words nor your passphrase
explanation: >-
  When you use a level 3 wallet, you need to backup both the list of 12
  or 24 words and your passphrase. This is because the list of words and the passphrase
  are both necessary for regaining access to your funds in case of loss of your phone
  or computer.
