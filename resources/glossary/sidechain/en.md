term: SIDECHAIN
---

A blockchain designed to operate in parallel with Bitcoin's main blockchain. The two chains are connected using a two-way peg that ensures the asset circulating on the sidechain retains the same value as bitcoin on the main chain. The sidechain has its own consensus mechanism, which can be independent or partially rely on the main chain's mechanism. It generally allows for the use of functionalities not directly available on the main chain, or for enhanced functionalities, such as: more flexibility in development, faster and/or more private transactions, or a higher transactional capacity. To achieve this, the sidechain makes compromises in comparison to the main chain.

The concept of a sidechain was initially introduced in 2014 by Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timon, and Pieter Wuille. Currently, the most well-known sidechains on Bitcoin are Liquid and RSK (Rootstock). However, these remain much less used compared to other overlay solutions with a different model, like the Lightning Network.
