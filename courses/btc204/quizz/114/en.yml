question: Why won't the analyst apply CIOH on a Stonewall type transaction?

answer: Because there are 2 outputs of the same amounts

wrong_answers:
  - Because there are only 2 inputs
  - Because they are not familiar with this pattern
  - Because there are more outputs than inputs

explanation: |
  Analyzing a Stonewall transaction from the outside does not lead to the application of CIOH, as the presence of two outputs of the same amount suggests a coinjoin pattern. From an external viewpoint, CIOH is therefore not applicable in this specific case.
