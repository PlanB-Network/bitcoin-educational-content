explanation: |
  Zero Interest Rate Policies (ZIRP) can have several unintended consequences.
  Banks have limited opportunities to rebuild their equity because their margins are
  eroded. They also have little incentive to lend, especially to entrepreneurs and
  other risk-takers. Instead, they allocate their resources to securitize existing
  capital or provide loans against collateral. Additionally, ZIRP encourages governments
  to engage in extensive spending, leading to a significant increase in public debt
  levels.
