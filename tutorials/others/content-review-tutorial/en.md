## What is PlanB Network?

Planb.network is a brand new platform for learning about Bitcoin through numerous courses and tutorials for everyone. Currently, all our content is open-source, hosted on a GitHub repo, and open to contributions for reviewing and creating content.

PlanB.network aims to become the public square of the Bitcoin cyberspace, connecting and encouraging Bitcoin communities around the world.

## Why Contribute?

PlanB.network is fundamentally multilingual, as our goal is to make Bitcoin resources accessible to everyone worldwide. We believe that language should not be a barrier to sovereign currency.

Therefore, we use a Human x AI approach to achieve this goal. Thanks to our [simple program](https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator), we can automatically translate our content into many languages. However, before publishing it, we need a person fluent in the language to review it to ensure the content is intelligible and free of inappropriate terms.

If you want to join us in building this educational project to promote Bitcoin education in your community, you can start by reviewing a course or tutorial.

Moreover, as Découvre Bitcoin (DB) is in charge of evaluating contributions and we (DB) cherish the *Value4Value* model, we will reward review contributions. The reward will be based on the length of the content, the linguistic accuracy of our auto-translation, and the difficulty of the content.

## Do I need to know how GitHub works?

You don't need to be a GitHub expert to review content.
Although it's always better to understand what you're doing (and why), you can simply follow the instructions below to contribute.

However, if you are completely unfamiliar with how Git and GitHub work and would like to learn more, you can discover [our introductory article on these tools](https://planb.network/tutorials/others/basics-of-github).

## 1. Create an account
* Create an account on GitHub to start contributing. If you need guidance on how to create your account on GitHub, we also have [a detailed tutorial](https://planb.network/tutorials/others/create-github-account).
## **2. Go to the project page of your language**
* The [project page](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content/projects?query=is%3Aopen) contains content in your language displayed on a Kanban board.
* Look for cards in the "Review Needed" column (see **A**). These are issues that you can review.
* Each card details (see **B**):
	- **Content Type**: Course, tutorial, or website
	- **Content Difficulty**
	- **Urgency**
	- **Word Count**
	- **Associated Reward**: Based on the content properties and the accuracy of the translation (see [Reward section](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content?tab=readme-ov-file#sat-reward))

NB. The review is best done in the code window with the original content in a separate window next to it.

## **5. Commit the changes**

* When you want to stop your review session, you can commit your changes, even if the review is not finished – it's a bit like "saving your changes on GitHub".
* Click on the "Commit Changes" button (see **A**).

![review](assets/6.webp)
* Add a descriptive message about your change (see **B**).* Add more context in the description if necessary (see **C**).

## **6. Create a PR with the dedicated branch**

* You can verify that this PR requests to merge your branch into the dedicated branch of the corresponding language (see **A**).
* Give the PR a descriptive name (see **B**).
* Add context in the description (see **C**).
* If not finished, click on the dropdown arrow next to "Create Pull Request" and select "Draft PR" (see **D**).
* Click on "Draft Pull Request."
* Congratulations on your first PR!

## **7. Continue the review later**
* If you have not finished your review and wish to continue your work, go to your fork of the sovereign-university content repository via your GitHub profile.
* Select the corresponding branch.
* Rename the branch if necessary.
* Find your content file and click on the pencil button to resume the review.

## **8. Commit directly on your own branch**
* Make commits to validate the changes directly on your branch as you progress.

## **9. Finish and set the PR as ready for review**
