   Bitcoin Bénin is Benin's community of Bitcoiners. It brings together the local community but is working to reach a much wider audience.

   Initiated by active members of the local community, Alphonse - Loïc & Samad, Bitcoin Bénin works to educate the local population on all aspects of Bitcoin through monthly Bitcoin Meetups, special sessions around Bitcoin topics, La Bitcoin School and many other special activities that reinforce good Bitcoin education.

   We have a growing community through WhatsApp, telegram, networks and Meetups and are working to develop programs that meet the needs of the whole community.
