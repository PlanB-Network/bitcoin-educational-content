term: BLOCK WITHHOLDING
---

A specific attack in pool mining. It is a malicious practice where a participant in the pool finds a block with a valid proof of work but does not share it with the pool. The attacker submits partial proofs of work (shares) to maintain the appearance of active participation but withholds the valid proof of work, thus depriving the pool of the block's rewards. This tactic aims to decrease the pool's earnings without directly benefiting from it, but by affecting its profitability.
