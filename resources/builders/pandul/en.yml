  I am Loïc Morel, a writer and Bitcoin advisor. I am the author of over a hundred technical articles on Bitcoin in French, some of which have become references, such as my work on BIP-47 translated into several languages.
  I am also the author of the Bitcoin Dictionary, a reference work that lists definitions of all technical terms related to Bitcoin and its ecosystem. I have also written the e-books Bitcoin and Cryptography and The Bitcoin Wallet. All my technical works are free and under a free license.
