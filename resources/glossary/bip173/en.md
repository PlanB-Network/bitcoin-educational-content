Introduced the bech32 address format for SegWit V0 addresses. This address format is characterized by the prefix `bc1q`. The bech32 format offers several advantages:
* It requires less space in QR codes;
* It is more easily interpretable by humans;
* It has an innovative checksum mechanism that is more efficient and allows for the detection and potential automatic correction of typos.
These features make the use of receiving addresses easier while minimizing the risk of errors.
