term: PIZZA DAY
---

Event celebrated every May 22 by the Bitcoin community to commemorate the first transaction of bitcoins for a physical good. In 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a Bitcoin developer, [proposed on the BitcoinTalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1141#msg1141) to buy two large pizzas for 10,000 BTC, then equivalent to about 40 dollars. On May 22, he confirmed that the offer had been accepted by a 19-year-old Californian student, Jeremy Sturdivant, known under the pseudonym Jercos. He ordered and had the pizzas delivered from Papa John's to Laszlo in Florida. This day marks an important moment for Bitcoin as it demonstrates its potential as a currency of exchange. Every year, the community celebrates this event by consuming pizzas paid for in bitcoins.
