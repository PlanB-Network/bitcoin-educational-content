term: PRNG (GNPA)
---

Acronym for "Pseudo-Random Number Generator." PRNGs are a category of algorithms used to generate sequences of numbers that are approximately random, starting from an initial state called a seed. In cryptography, PRNGs are used to produce keys, initialization vectors, and other elements requiring randomness. A good PRNG must have properties such as output uniformity, unpredictability, and resistance to predictive attacks. Unlike truly random number generators, PRNGs are deterministic and reproducible. On Bitcoin, PRNGs can be used in wallet management software or hardware wallets to generate the recovery phrase, which is the basis of deterministic and hierarchical wallets.
