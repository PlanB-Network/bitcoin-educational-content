term: UNCONFIRMED TRANSACTION
---

A Bitcoin transaction that has been broadcast to the network but has not yet been included in a block by a miner. It remains in the nodes' mempools, waiting to receive confirmations. Confirmation occurs when the transaction is integrated into a valid block that is added to the blockchain. The time it takes for a transaction to be confirmed depends on the transaction fees paid and the system's congestion.
