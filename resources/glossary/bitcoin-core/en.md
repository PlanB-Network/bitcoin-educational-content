Bitcoin Core is the reference open-source software for the Bitcoin system and is the main implementation of the Bitcoin protocol to date. It is developed and maintained by a large group of volunteer contributors. Initially named "Bitcoin Qt," it is the third client in the history of Bitcoin following Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, and Bitcoind. It was developed from Satoshi's original code and introduced a graphical user interface for the user. Moreover, even today, the graphical interface of Bitcoin Core is called `bitcoin-qt`. It has been packaged with `bitcoind` since version 0.5. Bitcoin Core software serves several purposes. First and foremost, it acts as a full node client. Bitcoin Core also includes a wallet for users who wish to store, manage, and conduct transactions directly with Bitcoin Core.
