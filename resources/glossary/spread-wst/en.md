In the Whirlpool Stat Tool software, the spread is an indicator used to measure the homogeneity of the mixing process from the perspective of a given piece. There are two types of spreads: prospective and retrospective.

The prospective spread is calculated as the ratio between the prospective anonset of your piece and the total number of pieces created after your Tx0. For example, if there are 100 pieces in your pool and your piece has an anonset of 70, then the prospective spread of your piece is 70%.

The retrospective spread, on the other hand, is the ratio between the retrospective anonset of your piece and the total number of Tx0 created before the last mix of your piece. Thus, if the retrospective anonset of your piece is 95 and there were 100 Tx0 before your last mix, then the retrospective spread of your piece is 95%.

These two indicators are used to assess the effectiveness of your piece's mixing relative to the potential offered by the pool. A low prospective spread, such as 5%, indicates a significant margin for possible improvement through additional mixes. Conversely, a high prospective spread, such as 97%, means that little additional anonset can be gained with additional coinjoins.
