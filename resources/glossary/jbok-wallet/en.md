term: JBOK (WALLET)
---

JBOK wallets, an acronym for "Just a Bunch Of Keys," refer to old Bitcoin wallets that stored a set of independently and pseudo-randomly generated key pairs. Unlike modern HD wallets, which generate keys in a deterministic and hierarchical manner from a single seed, JBOK wallets had no hierarchical or deterministic relationship between the keys. They were all independent of each other. Due to their less efficient management and the difficulty of backup, these wallets have become obsolete and were spontaneously replaced by more advanced HD solutions, as standardized in BIP32.
