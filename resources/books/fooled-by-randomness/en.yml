  "Fooled By Randomness" is a book written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb that explores the impact of randomness and probability on our lives, especially in the financial world. Taleb argues that humans are not wired to think probabilistically, and therefore we often make incorrect assumptions about the causes of success and failure. He provides examples from finance and everyday life to illustrate how randomness plays a significant role in our lives and offers suggestions for how to better navigate this uncertainty. The book challenges readers to reevaluate their approach to decision-making and consider the role of randomness in their lives.
