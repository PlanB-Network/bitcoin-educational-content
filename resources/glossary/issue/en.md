Within the context of Github and other code hosting platforms, an issue is a report that signals a bug, proposes an improvement, or suggests a new feature. It serves as a discussion point for contributors and allows for the tracking of tasks to be completed or problems to be solved in the project. As a Bitcoin user, you can assist the open-source software you use by reporting any potential bugs through issues on the project's repository.
