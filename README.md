# The Sovereign University Content Repo

Welcome to the Sovereign University Content Repo! There's a chance that if you are here, it is to contribute to this larger-than-us project, which aims at consolidating the first multilingual and open-source e-learning platform focused on Bitcoin. (If you're just lost on GitHub, visit our [website](https://sovereignuniversity.org/) to learn more about Bitcoin).

Assuming you're here to contribute, I will detail the inner workings of the content management and how you can assist us -- either by producing new content or translating/reviewing content in your language.

Thank you for your time, involvement, and effort in this project. Here we believe in a [value-for-value model](https://dergigi.com/2021/12/30/the-freedom-of-value/) and we'll do our best to reciprocate for your contribution based on your Proof-of-Work. Moreover, by participating in creating valuable Bitcoin resources for your local community, tips from them could also come your way.

## Repo Structure and Content Management

This repo is organized around three main directories, which are:

- `courses`: comprising all the lectures about Bitcoin, Lightning, Cryptography, Mining, and so on.
- `resources`: consisting of various types of resources about Bitcoin, such as books, company info, or podcasts.
- `tutorials`: consisting of how-to articles, categorized into themes like exchange, merchant, node, privacy, and so on.

Each individual content piece, which is a markdown file, is defined by its location in this tree structure and by its language in the name. For instance, the Italian tutorial about Nerd-Miner would have the following path: `sovereign-university-data/tutorials/mining/nerd-miner/it.md`.

The different images referred to in the content are saved in the `assets` folder, which is at the same level as the corresponding content.

That's essentially everything you need to know if you simply want to contribute.

## How to Contribute

### Become a Translator/Reviewer

To scale the translation process, we are testing a combined AI x Human approach. We believe that with the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), like the infamous ChatGPT, we can translate a vast number of resources in a relatively short amount of time. We therefore created a [simple program](https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator) that leverages the ChatGPT API to translate technical contents and can add support for an additional language with ease.

While this kind of automated translation is more effective and efficient than traditional methods, such as Google Translate or DeepL, it is far from perfect -- that's when the human factor comes in. Indeed, once new content is produced (pushed into the `main` branch), it is automatically translated into the supported languages. Then, those translations MUST be reviewed by a fluent language speaker to ensure high-quality content in all languages. Most of the time, these reviews will correct wrongly translated expressions or grammatical sentence structures.
Once content is reviewed, it will be reviewed by other peers before being merged into the dedicated branch for the corresponding language, which will periodically be merged into the main branch.

Now that you understand the high-level procedure of the translation, you can take a look at this [step-by-step tutorial](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFwLztXxSU/opLGXqKq2UOkXH6txgVUkA/edit?utm_content=DAFwLztXxSU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) for the translation/review process.

### Become a Content Producer

For now, DecouvreBitcoin is in charge of adding new pieces of content. But soon, we will open that process to outside contributions. Nevertheless, if you want to add some content, you should directly contact us via [mail](mailto:contact@decouvrebitcoin.com) or do it via the commit systeme.

### Join the Network

As part of the PlanB initiative we beleive in mutual support and sharing of knowledge between bitcoin communuties around the world. In order to archeive cohision, we are aiming to create a network of bitcoin node who will share the same value and together push a bottom up adoption approche.

To boothstrap this network we will be using the already existing amazing work of the BTCmap team and the effort of coordination of various bitcoin communuties over the last year such as 21(germanà) , 2140, decouvrebitcion, satoshrpiz and more. while the work accomplished over the years is enormous, we are proposing to move into the next step to organize a global effort in a more efficient way. If you want your communuty to join this new initiave we invite you to send us an EMail at rogzy@decouvrebitcoin.com

IN your application we would like to better understand your current communutoes situation so we can offer th ebest help possible. considere inclusing information like:

- your communuties name
- Your BTCmap link
- your size
- your past educational effort
- what are you need (grant, educational content, visibilitée)
- what's your 2024 communuties objectif

Amount other. The review process will require some time and effort from our team so try to provide all the necessary information in order to help it. thanks a lot
