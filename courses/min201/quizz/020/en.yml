question: What is the future concern regarding the use of Bitcoin block space?
answer: The future concern is that with the expected growth of the Lightning Network and the consequent increase in channel openings and closings, space in Bitcoin blocks will become increasingly valuable.
wrong_answers:
  - The future concern is that the size of Bitcoin blocks will become too large to manage.
  - The future concern is that the number of Bitcoin blocks will exceed the capacity of the network.
  - The future concern is that the complexity of Bitcoin blocks will increase, making them difficult to process.
explanation: |
  With the expected growth of the Lightning Network and the consequent
  increase in channel openings and closings, space in Bitcoin blocks will become increasingly
  valuable. This has led to discussions about the legitimate use of block space, with
  concerns about "spam" on the blockchain from transactions considered non-essential.
