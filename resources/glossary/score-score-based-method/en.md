term: SCORE (SCORE BASED METHOD)
---

A method for calculating the remuneration of miners within mining pools. This reward system is proportional but weighted by the time at which the share is submitted. The SCORE method values shares based on the time elapsed since the beginning of the mining cycle. The later a share is submitted in the cycle, the higher its value. This method encourages miners to stay because each time mining stops, the miner's score stagnates while the scores of others increase more rapidly.
