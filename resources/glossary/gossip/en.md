term: GOSSIP
---

In the context of Lightning, gossip is a communication protocol between nodes to share information about the current state and topology of the network. The gossip protocol allows nodes to know the dynamic state of payment channels and other nodes, in order to facilitate the routing of transactions across the network without requiring direct connections between all nodes.
