term: BITCOIN CASH (BCH)
---

Cryptocurrency system resulting from a hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC) that occurred on August 1, 2017, at block 478,558. This fork happened due to disagreements within the Bitcoin community regarding the solutions to adopt for solving the scaling issues of the protocol (Blocksize War). While Bitcoin implemented SegWit (soft fork) which includes a slight, indirect increase in block capacity, Bitcoin Cash opted for a direct increase in block size (hard fork), moving from 1 MB to 8 MB, with the goal of reducing transaction fees and improving confirmation times.
