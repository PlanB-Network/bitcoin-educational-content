term: BITCOIN XT

Bitcoin XT is a fork of Bitcoin launched in 2015 by the renowned developer Mike Hearn and supported by Gavin Andresen (former lead maintainer of Bitcoin following Satoshi's departure). Originally, Bitcoin XT was an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol compatible with Bitcoin Core. However, in August 2015, Bitcoin XT version 0.11A adopted BIP101: a proposed hard fork to increase the block size limit from 1 MB to 8 MB, with a planned doubling of this size every two years until reaching just over 8 GB per block in 2036. This proposal was one of the main causes of the Blocksize War that took place between 2015 and 2017. It was supported by a significant portion of miners, and by influential companies like BitPay, Blockchain.info, and Circle. Ultimately, Bitcoin XT failed to gain enough support from the community, and Mike Hearn would eventually announce his departure from the community and the sale of his bitcoins. He expressed his disappointment in a blog post, notably stating that Bitcoin had failed.
