  Antifragile, by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a book that proposes a new way of thinking about systems that are resilient to shocks and stressors. Taleb argues that antifragile systems don't just withstand stress, they thrive under it, gaining strength and resilience in the process. He applies this idea to economics, finance, and business, arguing that many systems are too fragile and that we should embrace antifragility to create more robust and sustainable systems. He also challenges conventional wisdom and offers practical advice on how to apply antifragile principles in our own lives and organizations.
