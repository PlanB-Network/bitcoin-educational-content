question: What is the meaning of the adage "Not your hashrate, not your reward" in the context of Bitcoin mining?
answer: If you do not control the hashrate, you do not control the mining rewards.
wrong_answers:
  - If you do not have a high hashrate, you will not get any rewards.
  - If you do not own Bitcoin, you will not get any rewards.
  - If you do not have a mining machine, you will not get any rewards.
explanation: |
  The adage "Not your hashrate, not your reward" is similar to the well-known
  adage in the world of cryptocurrencies, "Not your keys, not your Bitcoins." It means
  that if you do not control the hashrate, you do not control the mining rewards.
  This is because the rewards from mining are directly proportional to the hashrate.
