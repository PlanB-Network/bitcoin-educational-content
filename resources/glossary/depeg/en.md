term: DEPEG
---

Refers to the situation where the value of a digital asset, typically a debt instrument, becomes unlinked from the underlying asset to which it is normally indexed, leading to price fluctuations relative to that asset. This phenomenon is particularly observed with stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a strict parity with fiat currencies or other reference assets. Depegging can also occur in the case of bitcoin representations on sidechains or ETFs, where in the event of a problem, the nominal value may diverge from that of bitcoin.
