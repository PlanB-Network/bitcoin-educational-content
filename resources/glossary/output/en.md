term: OUTPUT

In the context of Bitcoin, an output within a transaction refers to the UTXOs (*Unspent Transaction Outputs*) that are created as destination funds for the payment. More specifically, it is a mechanism by which a transaction distributes funds.

A transaction takes UTXOs, that is, pieces of bitcoins, as inputs and creates new UTXOs as outputs. These outputs specify a certain amount of bitcoins, often assigned to a specific address, as well as the conditions under which these funds can be spent later. The role of the Bitcoin transaction is therefore to consume UTXOs as inputs, and to create new UTXOs as outputs. The difference between the two corresponds to the transaction fees that can be collected by the winning miner of the block. A UTXO is, in essence, the output of a previous transaction that has not yet been spent. Transaction outputs are thus the creations of new UTXOs that will, in turn, potentially be used as inputs in future transactions.

From a broader perspective, in computing, the term "output" generally refers to the data resulting from a function, an algorithm, or a system. For example, when data is passed through a cryptographic hash function, this information is named "input," and the result is named "output."
