Add proofreading metadata

author: asi0

## Purpose

- add the proofreading metadata section in all content yaml file
  - except `podcast.yml` and `event.yml` and `professor.yml`

## Usage

- `add-proofreading-metadata.py` is used to add the template section in all predefined yaml files
- `set-proofreading-reward.py` is used to compute and set the reward of any content for all supported langugages
- `update-proofreading-metadata.py` will be soonâ„¢ written and used to update the reward if a new `reviewers_id` has been added

## Depedencies

- `ruamel.yaml`

---

- for proofreading.py
  - [x] create a lib py file
  - [x] function: set urgency to value
  - [x] function: compute reward
  - [x] function: print the reward
  - [x] function: print the urgency
  - [x] function: print state of proofreading
  - [x] function: update yaml file with new values
  - [x] function: add new contributor to a language
- for update-proofreading-metadata
  - [x] function: add new supported language
  - [x] function: get specific data for given content and language
  - [x] function: ask for new contribution
  - [x] function to update proofreading metadata
  - [ ] function: add new language section for update process
    - hypothesis: for any new content there is ALWAYS at least the proofreading section in the original language with the author mentionned as the first proofreading
    - hypothesis 2: only check for code language present is a dictionnary with the associated language difficulty factor
    - this allows us to reduce the update process to a single case : check if {code_language}.yml or md does the code language is listed in the proofreading section
    - if so go on
    - otherwise
      - add the 4 properties
      - last_contribution_date
      - contributions_id
      - urgency:
      - reward:
      - set urgency to 1 per default
      - compute the corresponding reward
