PlanB's mission is to provide top-tier educational resources on Bitcoin in as many languages as possible. All content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, offering anyone the opportunity to contribute to the enrichment of the platform.

If you want to add a Bitcoin conference to the PlanB Network site and increase visibility for your event, but don't know how? This tutorial is for you!
![event](assets/01.webp)
- First, you need to have an account on GitHub. If you don't know how to create an account, we have made [a detailed tutorial to guide you](https://planb.network/tutorials/others/create-github-account).
- Go to [the GitHub repository of PlanB dedicated to data](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content/tree/dev/resources/conference) in the `resources/conference/` section:
![event](assets/02.webp)
- Click on the top right on the `Add file` button, then on `Create new file`:
![event](assets/03.webp)
- If you have never contributed to the contents of PlanB Network before, you will need to create your fork of the original repository. Forking a repository means creating a copy of that repository on your own GitHub account, allowing you to work on the project without affecting the original repository. Click on the `Fork this repository` button:
![event](assets/04.webp)
- You will then arrive at the GitHub editing page:
![event](assets/05.webp)
- Create a folder for your conference. To do this, in the `Name your file...` box, write the name of your conference in lowercase with dashes instead of spaces. For example, if your conference is called "Paris Bitcoin Conference", you should note `paris-bitcoin-conference`. Also add the year of your conference, for example: `paris-bitcoin-conference-2024`:
![event](assets/06.webp)
- To validate the creation of the folder, simply note a slash after your name in the same box, for example: `paris-bitcoin-conference-2024/`. Adding a slash automatically creates a folder rather than a file:
![event](assets/07.webp)
- In this folder, you will create a first YAML file named `events.yml`:
![event](assets/08.webp)
- Fill this file with information about your conference using this template:

```yaml
- start_date:
  end_date:
  address_line_1:
  address_line_2: 
  address_line_3: 
  name:
  builder:
  type: conference
  book_online: false
  book_in_person: false
  price_dollars: 0
  description:
  language: 
    - 
  links:
    website:
    replay_url:    
    live_url :
  tags: 
    - 
```

For example, your YAML file could look like this:

```yaml
- start_date: 2024-08-15
  end_date: 2024-08-18
  address_line_1: Paris, France
  address_line_2: 
  address_line_3: 
  name: Paris Bitcoin Conference 2024
  builder: Paris Bitcoin Conference
  type: conference
  book_online: false
  book_in_person: false
  price_dollars: 0
  description: The largest Bitcoin conference in France with over 8,000 participants each year!

- Once you have finished making changes to this file, save them by clicking on the `Commit changes...` button:
![event](assets/10.webp)
- Add a title for your changes, as well as a short description:
![event](assets/11.webp)
- Click on the green `Propose changes` button:
![event](assets/12.webp)
- You will then arrive at a page summarizing all your changes:
![event](assets/13.webp)
- Click on your GitHub profile picture at the top right, then on `Your Repositories`:
![event](assets/14.webp)
- Select your fork of the PlanB Network repository:
![event](assets/15.webp)
- You should see a notification at the top of the window with your new branch. It's probably called `patch-1`. Click on it:
![event](assets/16.webp)
- You are now on your working branch:
![event](assets/17.webp)
- Go back to the `resources/conference/` folder and select the folder of your conference that you just created in the previous commit:
![event](assets/18.webp)
- In the folder of your conference, click on the `Add file` button, then on `Create new file`:
![event](assets/19.webp)
- Name this new folder `assets` and confirm its creation by putting a slash `/` at the end:
![event](assets/20.webp)
- In this `assets` folder, create a file named `.gitkeep`:
![event](assets/21.webp)
- Click on the `Commit changes...` button:
![event](assets/22.webp)
- Leave the commit title as default, and make sure the `Commit directly to the patch-1 branch` box is checked, then click on `Commit changes`:
![event](assets/23.webp)
- Return to the `assets` folder:
![event](assets/24.webp)
- Click on the `Add file` button, then on `Upload files`: ![event](assets/25.webp)
- A new page will open. Drag and drop an image that represents your conference and will be displayed on the PlanB Network site:
![event](assets/26.webp)
- It can be the logo, a thumbnail, or even a poster:
![event](assets/27.webp)
- Once the image is uploaded, check that the `Commit directly to the patch-1 branch` box is ticked, then click on `Commit changes`:
![event](assets/28.webp)
- Be careful, your image must be named `thumbnail` and must be in `.webp` format. The full file name should therefore be: `thumbnail.webp`:
![event](assets/29.webp)
- Return to your `assets` folder and click on the intermediary file `.gitkeep`:
![event](assets/30.webp)
- Once on the file, click on the 3 small dots at the top right then on `Delete file`:
![event](assets/31.webp)
- Verify that you are still on the same working branch, then click on the `Commit changes` button:
![event](assets/32.webp)
- Add a title and a description to your commit, then click on `Commit changes`:
![event](assets/33.webp)
- Go back to the root of your repository:
![event](assets/34.webp)
- You should see a message indicating that your branch has undergone changes. Click on the `Compare & pull request` button:
![event](assets/35.webp)
- Add a clear title and a description to your PR:
![event](assets/36.webp)
- Click on the `Create pull request` button:
![event](assets/37.webp)
