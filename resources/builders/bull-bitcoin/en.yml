  Bull Bitcoin, Canada's premier Bitcoin-only exchange and payment service, offers a non-custodial, secure and private platform for your Bitcoin transactions. 

  You can purchase Bitcoin directly to your wallet using Interac E-Transfers and other Canadian bank transfer options, without any withdrawal fees or transaction limits. It also enables you to pay bills with Bitcoin, even if the recipient isn't a Bull Bitcoin user. Their VIP advisory service, Bull Bitcoin Prime, is tailored for high-net-worth individuals and institutions seeking to expand their Bitcoin engagement. 

  They also offer educational resources through BitcoinSupport.com for self-custody of your Bitcoin. Prioritizing Bitcoin ethos over profits, they have been trusted since 2013 for promoting Bitcoin education and adoption in Canada.
