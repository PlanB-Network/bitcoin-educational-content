PlanB's mission is to provide top-tier educational resources on Bitcoin in as many languages as possible. All content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, allowing anyone to participate in enriching the platform. Contributions can take various forms: correcting and proofreading existing texts, translating into other languages, updating information, or creating new tutorials not yet available on our site.

On PlanB, we already have many languages available on the website, and we are continuously working to add new ones. To efficiently translate the frontend, we use the Weblate tool, which facilitates collaboration and organizes translations. It's a very simple tool to get started with.

If your native language is not yet available on our site and you would like to contribute by adding it, this tutorial is for you!

## Checking for the Presence of a Language on PlanB Network

The first step is to check if your language is not already among those we are working on.

- Go to [our Weblate platform](https://weblate.planb.network/projects/planb-network-website/):
![language](assets/01.webp)
- In the `Website frontend element` menu, you will find a list of all the languages we are working on:

If your language is in this list, you do not need to add it again. To contribute to an existing language, we have made another tutorial that you can discover.

If your language is not there, follow the tutorial below to add it.

## Adding a New Language to PlanB Network

- The first step is to create an account on Weblate. If you do not know how to do this, you can follow our detailed guide.

- Once your account is created, go to the `Website frontend element` menu and select the `Languages` tab:

- Click on the `+` to the left of the window:
![language](assets/04.webp)
- Open the dropdown list, and select the language you wish to create on PlanB Network. If the language you are looking for is not available in the dropdown list, you can directly contact @asi0_flammeus on Telegram so they can create it manually:

- To start translating the frontend immediately, click on the `Translate` button: ![language](assets/08.webp)
To be guided through the translation process, check out our dedicated tutorial on this topic!

Congratulations, you have initiated the process of translating the PlanB Network site into a new language! You can begin by translating the entire frontend via Weblate.

 This includes all the texts on the website, except for educational content (courses, tutorials...) for which we use another semi-automated Humans x AI method.

Next, you can contact @asi0_flammeus on Telegram, who will assist you in reviewing some courses automatically translated with their model. If these contents are deemed satisfactory, you can proceed to review all the other content on the site (courses, tutorials...). Once these steps are completed, we can consider officially integrating the new language into the PlanB Network website, which will allow all speakers of your language to access quality content on Bitcoin, without any barriers.

A big thank you for your valuable contribution! :)
