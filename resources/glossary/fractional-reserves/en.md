term: FRACTIONAL RESERVES
---

The principle of traditional finance according to which banks only keep a fraction of their clients' deposits as available reserve, and use the rest to grant loans and generate profits. In the context of Bitcoin, although the currency itself is not subject to bank credit creation, the concept of fractional reserve applies when an exchange platform only keeps a part of the BTC deposited by its users, and uses the rest for other purposes. This poses a risk of liquidity and solvency if all users decide to withdraw their funds simultaneously. This is notably why it is essential to keep one's bitcoins in self-custody.
