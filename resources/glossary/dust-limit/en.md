term: DUST LIMIT
---

Refers to the threshold in sats below which a UTXO is considered as "dust" by a network node. This threshold is part of the standardization rules that can be modified independently by each node. In Bitcoin Core, this limit is determined by a specific fee rate, set by default at 3,000 sats per virtual kilobyte (sats/kvB). This limit aims to restrict the spread of transactions containing very small amounts of bitcoins. Indeed, a UTXO qualified as dust implies that its use is not economically rational: spending this UTXO would cost more than simply abandoning it. If spending dust is not rational, it suggests that such expenditures could only be motivated by external incentives, often malicious. This can be a problem if a malicious actor seeks to saturate the network with transactions containing minuscule amounts, with the aim of increasing the operational load on nodes and potentially preventing them from processing other legitimate transactions. To give an analogy (albeit a slightly clumsy one, I admit), it's a bit like someone trying to pay for a 100€ shopping basket entirely in 1 cent coins in order to block other customers at the checkout.
