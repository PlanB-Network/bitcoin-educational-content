question: What happens in a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network?
answer:
  An agent possesses more than half of the hashrate and can attempt to modify
  the blockchain.
wrong_answers:
  - An agent gains control over more than half of the bitcoins in circulation.
  - An agent gains control over more than half of the nodes in the Bitcoin network.
  - An agent gains control over more than half of the mining pools in the Bitcoin
    network.
explanation: >-
  In a 51% attack, an agent with more than half of the network's hashrate
  could potentially manipulate the blockchain by creating an alternate chain of blocks.
  However, such an attack would be extremely costly and unlikely to be profitable,
  making it an unlikely scenario.
