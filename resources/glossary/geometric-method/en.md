A method for calculating the remuneration of miners within the context of mining pools. This payment system is established on a score, designed to counter the phenomenon of pool hopping. It ensures that the payment per submitted share remains constant, regardless of the submission time. Miners accumulate scores, calculated with a decay factor, and payments are calculated at the end of the cycle. They are proportional to their score. This method involves variable and fixed fees for the miner and reduces the variance of payments per share.
