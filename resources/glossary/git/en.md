term: GIT
---

Distributed version control system designed to efficiently manage any type of software project. It enables developers to track changes made to a project's source code over time, revert to previous states, manage branches, and merge changes. Git facilitates collaboration among developers by allowing multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, without the risk of file conflicts. Each developer works locally and can then synchronize their changes with the central repository. Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, Git has become the de facto standard for version control in the software industry. The development of Bitcoin node implementations, including Bitcoin Core, is managed with Git.
