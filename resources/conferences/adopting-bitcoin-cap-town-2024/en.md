## One Shot Replace-By-Fee-Rate 

![video](https://youtu.be/u9RX1Qv2MSM?si=-29B7cdfJaN4c_9z)

Speaker: Peter Todd

Transaction pinning has been a longstanding concern, particularly BIP-125 Rule #3 pinning, where a large, low fee-rate, transaction prevents the confirmation of a small, high fee-rate, transaction. While replace-by-fee-rate has been long known to be a solution for Rule #3 pinning, it has been thought to have unavoidable DoS attacks and incentive issues.

Here we will show that a variant, One-Shot Replace-By-Fee-Rate, fixes these DoS attacks and miner incentives sufficiently well to be implementable in Bitcoin Core.

## Bitcoin and Free Private Cities 

![video](https://youtu.be/nDiWNM_cJmQ?si=l1VYJ0LvGqqIR7nl)

Speaker: Marthinus Grobler

This talk aims to introduce the concept of FreePrivateCities (FPCs) and the far-reaching synergies with Bitcoin and Bitcoin projects to bring about a future of liberty. The talk will also expand on the current developments in establishing FPCs and the implications for Bitcoin adoption. FPCs are established within a host-nation and has extensive legal and regulatory autonomy. It is a legally recognized jurisdiction and can therefore offer substantial protection to many endeavours furthering the cause of liberty, that might be unwelcome in authoritarian states. BTC and FPCs share the same core values. BTC’s eloquently solved governance is a great example for governance in FPCs. FPCs can accelerate transitions towards hard money (BTC adoption). Synergy between financial sovereignty and localized, autonomous and contractual governance is the next frontier for individual liberty.

Focus is specifically on the model of Free Private Cities as developed by dr. Titus Gebel: Special Administrative Zones that have the specific feature of being operated by a private company to maximise profits by satisfying resident-consumer wants. The governance itself is by a for profit corporation that has extensive legal and regulatory autonomy (negotiated with the host-nation) to direct the nature and interaction of the city, both internal and external.
Profit is the proof that society’s most urgent needs are served. This mechanism directs the allocation of resources to the wants and needs of society. Private money, of which BTC is superior, is key to this.
Freedom is something that you build
The core principle would be voluntary participation. A legal framework is developed to keep people accountable for their voluntary commitments in order to protect property rights of others.
This decentralization is inevitable and eventually networks of FPCs will form into leagues. This will include more abstract communities/fraternities/societies established with no geographical constraints but actualised by the jurisdictions afforded by different FPCs.
In a FPC, fractional reserve banking will be seen as fraudulent, favouring private money like BTC which:
Reduce negative effects of the business cycle
Gives access to monetary network without censorship
Reduce unbanked population
Offers a permissionless monetary network allowing FPCs to trade globally.
Reduce the unbanked population.
Other implications/features of a city/society built on sound money, property rights and voluntary commitments:
Superior price discovery
Individual freedoms
Stronger superorganisms of institutions, fraternities, societies
Beauty
Better architecture, urbanism and quality of life.


## South African Beef Initiative

![video](https://youtu.be/KQcLATQPquw?si=k3RosZuEM4cp_f6q)

Speaker: Andre Kauerauf

What does a South African beef initiative movement look like? How do South African farmers adopt a bitcoin model and regain control over their livestock and land.

I am a regenerative farmer in the KZN midlands. We raise chickens, cattle and goats and sell all our products direct to consumer.
Adopting a bitcoin standard has made some significant changes in the way we run the farm and make decisions about the future.
My goal is to share this experience with other South African farmers in the hope that it may impact their farm, and management decisions, positively. Why Bitcoin and Beef?

There is, however, a deeper aspect to what we have experienced in our farming business. When we lowered our time preference, we started engaging with the land, and the ecosystem as a whole, in a way we had not beed able to before.

## Building Parallel Economy on the Lightning Network

![video](https://youtu.be/anuceKNi5ow?si=VhJhtBdRKjvuaNle)

Speaker: Kudzai Kutukwa

The Lightning Network (LN), a second-layer solution to Bitcoin’s scalability issues, represents a vibrant frontier for immediate, low-cost, and secure transactions. Our discussion, “Building a Parallel Economy with the Lightning Network,” aims to unveil the vast potential of LN in fostering a resilient, inclusive, and decentralized economic infrastructure that empowers communities worldwide.

This talk will begin with a brief introduction to the Lightning Network’s functionality and its significance in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. It will further delve into LN’s role in enabling quick microtransactions, which are essential for a thriving, inclusive parallel economy. Attendees will glean insights into how the LN facilitates trade, remittances, and financial access in areas where traditional banking structures are inadequate or non-existent.

I will cover various case studies showcasing different communities that have ingeniously leveraged the Lightning Network to establish self-sustaining economic models. These stories will underscore the LN’s transformative potential in enhancing self-sovereignty, financial independence, and community resilience.

This engaging and informative session is intended for enthusiasts from all walks of life, from Bitcoin novices to seasoned professionals. The ultimate goal is to, foster a deeper understanding of the Lightning Network’s unparalleled potential in building parallel economies that are robust, inclusive, and genuinely decentralized.

Learning Objectives:

1.Understanding the fundamentals and operations of the Lightning Network.
2.Exploring the potential of LN in facilitating microtransactions and financial inclusivity.
3.Highlighting real-life applications of the LN by community champions and organizations.
4.Discussing the future prospects and challenges of building a parallel economy with the LN.

## Fostering Bitcoin Communities

![video](https://youtu.be/US7dCutmPYM?si=HmtgbxU12XBFoCIV)

Preaching to the choir is a regular occurance in the bitcoin ecosystem. On the other hand, mass adoption is the only way for bitcoin to truly fulfill its purpose. The onus is on us as bitcoiners to reach out to the masses - Create awareness, ignite interest & desire, and handhold people to the fundamentals of money, value, and the promise of bitcoin.

Stay humble, stack sats is not enough. The stack needs to get deployed. Used in day-to-day life. People need to want to use bitcoin.

Effective community building is a powerful means to spark this want. What has worked for us as we built Bitcoin4India is to create a laidback environment, have a lose agenda for meetups, while ensuring that we organized many meetups. Behind the scenes, using all the tools available to us, and preferred by people, to connect with one another.

In essence, how to create and sustain momentum while building a community, with an aim to welcome no-coiners into our fold is what I aim to talk about.

Key Themes

1) Introduction - How we started Bitcoin4India and other African Bitcoin communities.

2) Our learnings and insights - (a) Everyone gets drawn to the shitcoin casino first. (b) The journey from shitcoin to bitcoin-only is interesting to say the least. Some get it in an instant, many take much longer. (c) Use the platforms that people like to use. In our case it has been Whatsapp and Meetup.com. (d) Be gentle on no-coiners. Meet them where they are. (e) People wanting to self-organize meetups and events is a win.

3) Similarities between India and Africa - Both are vibrant cultures comprising of several sub-cultures, customs and traditions. People have strong ties with their family and community. Its easy for an Indian to understand the term pan-Africanism. Its easy for us to understand the concept of Ubuntu.

4) Differences between Indian and African climate - (a) Africa could be the best example of slowly then suddenly - (b) The need of bitcoin is not felt in India yet, but its a burning need in Africa due to inflation, currency devaluation and censorship. (c) Africa needs bitcoin solutions made by Africans.

Conclusion: (a) Its about making people feel welcome into the community. (b) The west's narratives around bitcoin won't necessarily work in/for Africa. Africa needs to have its own bitcoin narrative. (c) Momentum is key to building a community. (d) Give people various platforms - online and off, if sustained and nurtured well, the community starts growing organically.
