A set of software tools providing the necessary resources for developers to create applications on a specific platform. An SDK includes libraries, development guides, code samples, and compilation processes. SDKs facilitate and accelerate development by offering reusable modules. On Bitcoin, there is the BDK (*Bitcoin Dev Kit*) and the LDK (*Lightning Dev Kit*).
