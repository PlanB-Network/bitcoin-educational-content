One of the most exciting propositions of fiat currencies is certainly being able to exchange them for bitcoins, ideally without even having to identify oneself too much; a method often referred to as no-KYC or KYC-free. The acronym 'KYC' refers to the process of verifying the identity of a particular individual or entity in accordance with certain government regulations.

The majority of Bitcoin exchanges are regulated and therefore required to verify the identity of their customers in order to allow them to buy bitcoins on their platform. Users must provide various personal information such as name, address, phone number, one or more identification documents, etc., in order to be allowed to place a bitcoin purchase order.

This practice is undoubtedly an invasion of privacy and confidentiality for citizens simply seeking to acquire a currency, in the case of Bitcoin, completely detached from the fiat system controlled by the desires of an omniscient central bank.

## Use Bull Bitcoin to buy bitcoins with cash in Canada

In Canada, it is now possible to use one of these exchanges to acquire bitcoins with cash, all without KYC. Indeed, Bull Bitcoin, a reputable Canadian company in operation since 2015 led by Francis Pouliot, offers the payment method 'Cash or Debit at Canada Post' to its users who have acquired the 'Limited' status, which is granted to them once they have provided their name and a verified email address.

## Funding the account via Canada Post

The payment method 'Cash or Debit at Canada Post' to fund the account in order to buy bitcoins can be found in the 'Fund your account' section of the website (also available in mobile version on web browser). In this section, you will find the payment method and corresponding instructions, as well as the QR code associated with the Bull Bitcoin account (once the 'Limited' status is reached).
The operation is quite simple: you need to go to one of the 5948 Canada Post counters and present your QR code to the clerk, who will simply scan it using the regular Post Canada scanner.

Then, you just need to specify the amount you want to spend (between $10.00 and $999.99) and pay in cash or by debit card. After 10 minutes, the transaction will be completed on Bull Bitcoin. Fees of $3.50 to $3.95 apply, depending on the amount, when making the transaction at the post office. These fees are considerably lower than those found with Bitcoin ATMs, another popular option that is free of KYC.

Note that daily and weekly transaction limits of $999.99 and $2500.00 apply, respectively. Any attempt to exceed these limits when making a payment at the post office will simply result in the transaction being automatically canceled.

## Buying bitcoins directly to your own wallet on Bull Bitcoin

When funds are available in your Bull Bitcoin account, it's time to move on to the step of buying bitcoins! Go to the 'Buy Bitcoin' page located in the main menu. From there, you will need to enter the amount of your balance that you want to spend, as well as the network of your choice (Bitcoin, Lightning Network, Liquid).

For the Bitcoin and Liquid networks, you will need to share an address in order to create the purchase order. As for the Lightning network, Bull Bitcoin offers two different payment methods: LNURL (the default option) or Bolt11, once the order is created.

Essentially, the LNURL option is the simplest: a QR code is generated and the user must use a Lightning wallet that supports this protocol to scan it and claim the bitcoins. Bull Bitcoin requires a 'fallback' Bitcoin address in order to confirm the transaction. This address is used in the event that the Lightning transaction fails, for multiple reasons. Therefore, it is the recommended option.

As for Bolt11, it is the traditional method of the Lightning network. Unlike LNURL, it is the user who must create the invoice with their Lightning wallet, and then provide the details to Bull Bitcoin before confirming the purchase order. This option involves a certain risk of error by the user, who must manually enter the amount in bitcoins provided by Bull Bitcoin into their wallet when creating the invoice, and then share it with Bull Bitcoin. However, the method works very well when used correctly.

Once the purchase order is confirmed, Bull Bitcoin will send the bitcoins directly to your wallet. There is no alternative; Bull Bitcoin is a non-custodial platform that does not offer any bitcoin custody services for its users, and that's perfect! Learning to hold your own bitcoins is simply the best practice.

## Conclusion

While several other services, including Binance and Bybit, have abandoned the Canadian market, Bull Bitcoin, true to its avant-garde reputation, has positioned itself to meet the growing demand of bitcoiners seeking increased privacy and confidentiality. As Bull Bitcoin only offers non-custodial Bitcoin services, the increasingly strict regulations do not have the same effects as on custodial platforms supporting a multitude of shitcoins.
