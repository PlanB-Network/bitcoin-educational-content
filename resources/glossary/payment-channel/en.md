term: PAYMENT CHANNEL
---

Within the framework of the Lightning Network, a payment channel is a bidirectional connection between two Lightning nodes that allows for off-chain bitcoin exchanges. On-chain, a payment channel is represented by a 2/2 multisignature address held by both participants. The payment channel requires an on-chain transaction for its opening and another for its closure. Between these two events, channel users can carry out a very large number of off-chain bitcoin exchanges on the Lightning Network, without necessitating on-chain activity. On Lightning, it is possible to route a payment through several channels and nodes, in order to send bitcoins without necessarily opening a direct channel with the receiver.
