term: HARD FORK
---

A change to the protocol rules in a way that is not backward compatible. This change leads to a permanent separation of the Bitcoin network of nodes into two distinct groups: nodes with the update and nodes without the update. This split is materialized by the division of the original blockchain into two separate blockchains, which, however, share a common history, hence the use of the term "fork," which can be translated into French as "embranchement, bifurcation."

A change is said to be not backward compatible when it is either extensive, meaning it removes or makes certain rules of the protocol less restrictive, or bilateral, meaning it adds rules that are incompatible with the old ones. In other words, a hard fork occurs when certain nodes make a block that was invalid become valid. This results in the formation of a new version of the protocol, which can either replace the original Bitcoin if a majority is found, or become an independent altcoin if it is only used on the margins. For example, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard fork of Bitcoin. The fork occurred at block number 478,559, on August 1, 2017.
