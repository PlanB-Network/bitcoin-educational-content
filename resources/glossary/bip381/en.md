Introduces functions for descriptors, notably `pk(KEY)` (Pay-to-PubKey), `pkh(KEY)` (Pay-to-PubKey-Hash), and `sh(SCRIPT)` (Pay-to-Script-Hash). These functions standardize the way to describe Legacy script types in descriptors. BIP381 was implemented along with all other descriptor-related BIPs (except BIP386) in version 0.17 of Bitcoin Core.
