term: RSMPPS

Acronym for "*Recent Shared Maximum Pay Per Share*". It is a method for calculating the remuneration of miners within mining pools. RSMPPS is similar to SMPPS, but with a priority given to miners who have contributed recently. This method aims to reward current contributions by increasing the value of shares submitted in the most recent mining rounds, in order to favor miners who remain active and loyal.
