# Bibliography

This folder should contains only `.bib` file. 

What is a `.bib` file ? [Open, Edit, and Convert BIB and BIBTEX Files](https://www.lifewire.com/bibtex-file-2619874#:~:text=BIB%20files%20can%20be%20opened,the%20Notepad%20program%20in%20Windows.)

On Mac I recommend [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/). It's easy to use, with a good visualisation.
