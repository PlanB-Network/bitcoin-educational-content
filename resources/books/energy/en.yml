  In "Energy: A Human History," Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes takes us on a captivating journey through the transitions of energy sources over time. From wood to coal, from coal to oil, and now the emergence of natural gas, nuclear power, and renewable energy, Rhodes explores the pivotal role of energy in shaping the course of human history.
  Through a cast of influential characters spanning five centuries, including Queen Elizabeth I, Benjamin Franklin, John D. Rockefeller, and Henry Ford, Rhodes illuminates the successes and failures that led to breakthroughs in energy production. He delves into the lessons learned from each challenge, the mastery of transitions, and the ability to seize opportunities.
  Rhodes also examines the current energy landscape, exploring the competition between wind energy and traditional sources like coal and natural gas. He confronts the pressing issue of global warming and the implications of a rapidly growing global population.
  "Energy" reminds us that throughout history, humans have grappled with extracting life from raw materials. Each invention, discovery, and adaptation has brought its own set of challenges, leading us to where we stand today. With his distinctive storytelling style, Rhodes demonstrates how understanding our energy history can shape a more informed and sustainable future.
