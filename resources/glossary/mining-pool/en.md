term: MINING POOL
---

Refers to a group of miners who collaborate by combining their computing power to participate in the search for valid proof of work on Bitcoin. This pooling into a single organization is a solution to the increasing difficulty of mining bitcoins, which makes it too improbable for an individual miner to compete and earn rewards consistently. Miners within a mining pool contribute with their machines to the search for valid shares. When a block is mined by the pool, the reward, which includes the newly created bitcoins as well as the transaction fees included in the block, is distributed among the pool members according to the chosen payment method. This distribution is proportional to the computing power each miner has contributed.

By joining forces, miners within a pool increase their chances of finding blocks and thus reduce their variance. This ensures a more regular and predictable source of income compared to solo mining, where a miner may not earn a reward for long periods. They can thus smooth out their earnings, and therefore have a better visibility on their activity, especially to cope with the various expenses it entails.
