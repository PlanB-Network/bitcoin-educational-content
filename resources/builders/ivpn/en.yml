  IVPN is a privacy-focused VPN service that does not log user activity and does not collect or store personal data upon sign-up. We accept payments in cash, Monero, and Bitcoin. We are committed to transparency and security, with our website and all IVPN apps being open-source.

  Our servers, including email and live chat, are self-hosted and operated by us. We commit to annual independent security audits and don't indulge in false advertising, such as paying for reviews or promising anonymity.

  We regularly contribute to organizations like the EFF, Open Rights Group, and the Tor project. Our business model relies solely on paid subscriptions, without any ancillary services or VPN review sites.

  Our features include a choice of WireGuard, OpenVPN or IPSec protocols, AntiTracker that blocks ads and trackers, Killswitch/Firewall option, private non-logging DNS servers, multi-hop VPN routes, port forwarding, and Obfsproxy to circumvent censorship.

  While we clarify that VPNs can't achieve anonymity or prevent data collection by giants like Google or Facebook, we assure that a trustworthy VPN like ours can effectively encrypt your data and DNS requests, increase security on untrusted public networks, mask your IP address, and circumvent censorship or geographical blocks. We're a reliable part of your privacy protection strategy, provided you trust us more than your ISP.
