The email box is a central element of your online activity and often plays a crucial role in your computer security. If an attacker manages to compromise your email box, they gain easy access to your other accounts via the "*forgot password*" function. This can allow them to control your social networks, your bank accounts, and other online services, because today, the email address is often used as a unique identifier of your online identity. Therefore, securing your email box is very important to protect yourself from attacks.

To ensure the security of your email box, it is important to adopt some simple good practices that we study in this tutorial aimed at beginners in computing. It is also important to choose a secure email provider offering advanced protection options and a robust privacy protection policy. That's why I recommend in this tutorial to discover ProtonMail. Even if you prefer not to use this provider, the good practices presented here can be applied to any email box to enhance its security.

## Why use ProtonMail?

ProtonMail is a rather secure messaging solution thanks to several features. Firstly, ProtonMail ensures end-to-end encryption of your emails, which means that only the sender and recipient can read their content. In theory, even ProtonMail cannot access its users' emails. This encryption is applied automatically, without requiring any specific technical skills from the users.

Moreover, ProtonMail integrates advanced technologies to protect your privacy, including blocking certain tracking systems and masking your IP address. Being based in Switzerland, the Proton company benefits from some of the data protection laws that are not found in other countries. Additionally, ProtonMail is open-source, which allows independent experts to freely audit the software code.

The business model of Proton is based on a subscription system, which is reassuring since it indicates that the company is financed without necessarily exploiting its users' data. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the free version of ProtonMail, but there are also several subscription levels offering more features. This business model is preferable to an entirely free system, which could lead to concerns about whether our personal data is being used for profit. Fortunately, this does not seem to be the case with ProtonMail.

## Creating a Proton account

Visit the official proton site: https://proton.me/

Click on the "*Create an account*" button:
You have the option to choose from different plans according to your needs. To start, you can opt for a free account, which will allow you to test the basic services of ProtonMail. Later, if you wish to access additional features and other Proton software such as Calendar, VPN, or Password Manager, you can consider subscribing to a paid plan.

You then arrive at the account creation page.

You can choose the domain name you prefer for your email address by clicking on the small arrow. This choice has no impact on what follows.

Also, choose the username for your email address.

You are then asked to set a password. It is important to choose a strong password at this stage, as it will allow access to your mailbox. A robust password should be as long as possible, use a wide variety of characters, and be chosen randomly. In 2024, the minimum recommendations for a secure password are 13 characters including numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as symbols, provided that the password is truly random. However, I recommend opting for a password of at least 20 characters, including all possible types of characters, to ensure its security for longer.

The use of a password manager is an excellent practice. Not only does it allow you to store your passwords securely without having to memorize them, but it can also generate long and random passwords for you. Humans are indeed very bad at creating random sequences, and a password that is not random enough can be vulnerable to brute force attacks. I also recommend consulting our complete tutorial on setting up a password manager for more details on this topic:

Click on the "*Create Account*" button.

Solve the CAPTCHA.

Choose a display name. This is the name that will be shown to your recipient when you send an email. Choose your real name or a nickname.
Proton also offers you the option to set up a method for recovering your account, either via your phone number or with an alternate email address. It's important to understand that this option can increase the attack surface of your email inbox. For you, it's an additional security measure to regain access to your account in case you forget your password, but for a hacker, it's an extra opportunity to attempt to break into your account. You are not required to choose this recovery option, but if you decide not to, make sure to keep a secure copy of your password. Without it, if you lose your password, you will be unable to recover access to your email inbox.
