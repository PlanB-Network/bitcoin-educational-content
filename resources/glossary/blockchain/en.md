term: BLOCKCHAIN
---

Blockchain is the term commonly given to the distributed timestamp server of the Bitcoin system. It is a chain of blocks. Each block is linked to the next by its cryptographic hash. To prevent double spending on Bitcoin without resorting to a central authority, each user must verify the non-existence of a transaction in the system. The only way to ensure a transaction's absence is to be aware of all past Bitcoin transactions. To this end, transactions are timestamped within blocks, and each user has access to the entirety of the blockchain.

> ► *Following the numerous marketing misuses of the term "Blockchain," especially towards the end of the 2010s, many bitcoiners refuse to use this word. Some prefer to talk about "TimeChain" to evoke this concept. Others, referring to Satoshi Nakamoto's White Paper, mention a "Proof-of-Work Chain." In French, the English term "Blockchain" is generally accepted. The translation "chaîne de blocs" can also be used.*
