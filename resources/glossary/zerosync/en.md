Project developed to leverage ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) within the Bitcoin ecosystem, aiming to enhance scalability and privacy of the system. Their main protocol (also named *ZeroSync*) allows for the compression of the Bitcoin blockchain history, in order to speed up the initial synchronization of nodes with the network through the use of a compact proof, without compromising verification.
