## What is PlanB Network?

Planb.network is a brand new platform for learning about Bitcoin through numerous courses and tutorials for everyone. Currently, all our content is open-source, hosted on a GitHub repo, and open to contributions for reviewing and creating content.

PlanB.network aims to become the public square of the Bitcoin cyberspace, connecting and encouraging Bitcoin communities around the world.

## Why Contribute?

PlanB.network is fundamentally multilingual, as our goal is to make Bitcoin resources accessible to everyone worldwide. We believe that language should not be a barrier to sovereign currency.

Therefore, we use a Human x AI approach to achieve this goal. Thanks to our [simple program](https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator), we can automatically translate our content into many languages. However, before publishing it, we need a person fluent in the language to review it to ensure the content is intelligible and free of inappropriate terms.

If you want to join us in building this educational project to promote Bitcoin education in your community, you can start by reviewing a course or tutorial.

Moreover, as Découvre Bitcoin (DB) is in charge of evaluating contributions and we (DB) cherish the *Value4Value* model, we will reward review contributions. The reward will be based on the length of the content, the linguistic accuracy of our auto-translation, and the difficulty of the content.

## Do I need to know how GitHub works?

You don't need to be a GitHub expert to review content.
Although it's always better to understand what you're doing (and why), you can simply follow the instructions below to contribute.

However, if you are completely unfamiliar with how Git and GitHub work and would like to learn more, you can discover our introductory article on these tools.

## **2. Go to the project page of your language**
* The [project page](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content/projects?query=is%3Aopen) contains content in your language displayed on a Kanban board.
* Look for cards in the "Review Needed" column (see **A**). These are issues that you can review.
* Each card details (see **B**):
	- **Content Type**: Course, tutorial, or website
	- **Content Difficulty**
	- **Urgency**
	- **Word Count**
	- **Associated Reward**: Based on the content properties and the accuracy of the translation (see [Reward section](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content?tab=readme-ov-file#sat-reward))
