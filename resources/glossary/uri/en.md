term: URI
---

Acronym for "*Uniform Resource Identifier*". It is a standardized string format used to identify a resource on the Internet. A URI can be either a URL (*Uniform Resource Locator*), which provides a means to access a resource by indicating its location on a computer network, or a URN (*Uniform Resource Name*), which names the resource without specifying how to locate it. URIs are important in the functioning of the *World Wide Web*, as they enable access to resources such as web pages, documents, and services.

In the context of Bitcoin, a URI is specifically used to facilitate transactions. It allows for the encoding of a receiving address, as well as other transaction parameters like the amount, in a standardized format according to BIP21. This simplifies the payment process by enabling users to click on a link or scan a QR code, which automatically integrates the necessary information into their Bitcoin wallet application.
