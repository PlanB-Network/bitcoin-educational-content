question: What is the role of capital goods in the economy?
answer: Capital goods are used in the production of other goods. They enable individuals
  to obtain consumer goods.
wrong_answers:
  - Capital goods are used for consumption.
  - Capital goods have no role in the economy.
  - Capital goods are used to produce other capital goods.
explanation: |
  To produce consumer goods, entrepreneurs combine various intermediate
  goods with original factors of production (labor, land, and capital) according to
  a pattern that maximizes the resulting production. All other goods in the economy,
  which we can call "intermediate goods," only have value because they enable individuals
  to obtain these consumer goods; they are goods used in the production of other goods.
