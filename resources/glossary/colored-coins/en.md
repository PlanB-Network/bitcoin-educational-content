A method proposed in 2012 by Yoni Assia, Vitalik Buterin, and Meni Rosenfeld that allows for the representation and management of non-native assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. The idea was to attach metadata to specific transactions, in order to "color" bitcoins to indicate their association with physical assets. The first functional implementation, the Open Assets protocol, was developed by Flavien Charlon in 2013. This protocol enabled the marking of bitcoins using `OP_RETURN`.
