PlanB's mission is to provide leading educational resources on Bitcoin in as many languages as possible. All content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, which allows anyone to participate in enriching the platform. Contributions can take various forms: correcting and proofreading existing texts, translating into other languages, updating information, or creating new tutorials not yet available on our site.

If, while consulting one of our educational contents (tutorials, training, resources...), you identify an error, whether it is a spelling mistake, grammar, a slight translation error in your native language, or even a typo, we would be very grateful if you could propose a quick correction yourself.

This tutorial guides you step by step through the process of correcting these minor errors. It is a tutorial intended for beginners who do not wish to venture into the intricacies of Git. However, if you are comfortable with Git, here is a quick summary: you just need to fork [the PlanB Network data repository](https://github.com/DecouvreBitcoin/sovereign-university-data), make changes on a dedicated branch, and submit a Pull Request against the `dev` branch of the source repository.

Please note that if you plan to perform a complete review and revision of a document, especially for content translations, I invite you to consult this other more detailed tutorial.

 Here, we focus only on how to make a quick correction for a small error.

- First, you need to have an account on GitHub. If you do not know how to create an account, we have made a detailed tutorial to guide you.

- Go to [the GitHub repository of PlanB dedicated to data](https://github.com/DecouvreBitcoin/sovereign-university-data):

- Here, you will find all our content organized by part.
- If you wish to modify a tutorial, for example, go to the `tutorials` folder:
![typos](assets/02.webp)
- You will then find the different categories of tutorials on our website. For example, if you want to modify a tutorial in the `Privacy` category, click on the corresponding folder:
![typos](assets/03.webp)
- Then select the folder corresponding to the content you wish to correct:
![typos](assets/04.webp)
- In each content folder, you will find the data available in different languages. For example, the `en.md` file corresponds to the English version of the tutorial, while the `fr.md` file represents the French version. Select the file corresponding to the language you wish to modify: ![typos](assets/05.webp)
- You will then arrive at the GitHub page of the content. Make sure you are on the document you are looking to modify: ![typos](assets/06.webp)
- Click on the small pencil icon at the top left: ![typos](assets/07.webp)
- If you have never contributed to PlanB Network's content before, you will need to create your fork of the original repository. Forking a repository means creating a copy of that repository on your own GitHub account, which allows you to work on the project without affecting the original repository. Click on the `Fork this repository` button: ![typos](assets/08.webp)
- You will then arrive at the GitHub editing page: ![typos](assets/09.webp)
- Make your text modifications to correct the errors you had spotted. Don't be afraid, you are currently on your own fork, so this will not change anything on the PlanB Network site for the moment. For example, here, let's imagine that I modified the word "entr√©es" because it had a spelling mistake: ![typos](assets/10.webp)
- Once your corrections on this document are completed, you can click on the green `Commit Changes...` button. A commit is like an instant snapshot of your work at a given moment, which allows keeping a history of the changes: ![typos](assets/11.webp)
- Add a title for your modifications, as well as a short description: ![typos](assets/12.webp)
- Click on the green `Propose changes` button: ![typos](assets/13.webp)
- You will then arrive at a page that summarizes all your changes: ![typos](assets/14.webp)
- Scrolling down, you can see the specific modifications you have made: ![typos](assets/15.webp)
- If everything suits you and you have finished your modifications, you can click on the green `Create Pull Request` button: ![typos](assets/16.webp)
- You will arrive at the PR page. A Pull Request is a request sent by a contributor to indicate that they have pushed modifications on a branch in a remote repository and that they wish these modifications to be reviewed and potentially merged into the main branch of the repository: ![typos](assets/17.webp)
- You can add a title and a short description for your PR: ![typos](assets/18.webp)
- If everything looks good to you, you can click on the green `Create Pull Request` button: ![typos](assets/19.webp)
- Congratulations, your PR has been sent! You can follow its progress in the `Pull requests` tab on [the PlanB Network GitHub repository](https://github.com/DecouvreBitcoin/sovereign-university-data/pulls) :![typos](assets/20.webp)
