term: AOPP
---

Acronym for "*Address Ownership Proof Protocol*". It is a controversial protocol designed to automatically prove the ownership of Bitcoin addresses. This mechanism allows users to demonstrate that they control a specific address, directly through their compatible wallet software. Initially, AOPP was created to simplify the verification of address ownership, a legal requirement for clients wishing to transfer their bitcoins out of exchange platforms in certain jurisdictions, such as Switzerland.

However, this protocol has been the subject of significant criticism within the Bitcoin community, as it could establish a precedent where users would need to ask for permission to exercise their right to self-custody of their own funds. In response to these criticisms, many wallet software have chosen not to adopt this protocol.
