@article{fogcomputing,
	abstract = {Summary Fog computing has become a complementary technology to cloud computing and addresses some of the cloud computing threats such as the response time and network bandwidth demand. Fog computing successes processing data and storing data near to the edge, and usually is combined with container virtualization to provide hardware isolation. Empowered by these capabilities, numerous Internet of Things (IoT) applications are developed as virtualized instances on resource-constrained fog nodes such as single-board computers (SBC). In addition, blockchain has emerged as a key technology that is transforming the way we share information. Blockchain technology represents a decentralised, distributed, and immutable database ledger and is a potential solution for the distributed ecosystem of IoT applications. The distributed structure of blockchain is naturally suitable for IoT applications. However, it introduces new challenges related to CPU overhead or response time. This paper proposes a layered architecture that integrates blockchain technology and OS-level virtualization technology to develop fog-based IoT applications. It also provides insights for future deployments through a proof-of-concept use case harnessing SBCs, in this case Raspberry Pi, as blockchain-enabled fog nodes to drive virtualized IoT applications. The study shows that the maximum CPU overhead added by a permissioned blockchain based on Ethereum on the Raspberry Pi is around a 25\% under stress situations while the overhead introduced by the sealer process is negligible. These results support the feasibility of using blockchain on resource-constrained fog nodes for supporting IoT applications.},

@mastersthesis{query-thesis,
	abstract = {With blockchain becoming more popular, more and more application logic is moved to the blockchain
in the form of Smart Contracts. Although the blockchain stores an immutable history of all interaction
with- and resulting states of each Smart Contract, the way this data is stored makes it difficult and
inefficient to access. We try to solve this problem by synchronizing the relevant data from a blockchain
with a traditional database. We maintain a level of data integrity by constructing Merkle proofs for
each data element, which allows the user and other parties to verify the resulting data. By decoupling
our solution from the blockchain, we try to provide compatibility with existing platforms and Smart
Contracts, and we try to make the system usable without extensive knowledge of blockchain technology.
We evaluate both the functionality and performance of our solution by comparing it with a naive solution.
Our solution supports a number of SQL queries, and can prove that the resulting data also exists on the
blockchain. Our solution is faster than the naive solution when the entire blockchain is already indexed,
or when only a small amount of transactions have been added since the last time a query was issued.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin pricing mechanism is a complex system of interactions between factors that are not standard for traditional financial assets. Its understanding is essential for assessing specific topics, most prominently the interaction between Bitcoin price and network's hashrate as it directly translates into its power demand and consumption and thus also environmental implications. We examine an intertwined system of equations, controlling for various statistical caveats connected to such system, providing a coherent picture of the system dynamics and thus delivering the most rigorous and complex approach in explaining the pricing dynamics of the Bitcoin system up to date. We shown that the whole system is very well structured and delivers economically and logically sound results, pointing at the network security narrative in the Bitcoin price--hashrate nexus.},

@article{deep-learning-blch,
	abstract = {In order to study the use of in-depth learning to process financial data, it is proposed that the related technology of neural network and deep learning can be applied to financial data, and real stock index and futures data can be used to explore the application effect of neural network and in-depth learning. Firstly, the theory and model of in-depth learning and neural network are introduced in detail. Secondly, a simple neural network and in-depth learning model are used in the stock index and futures price forecast. The data used in the input of the model include the price of a stock in the current trading and some data indicators, and the closing price of a stock in the next time. The decline will be reflected in output. If the output is up for 1 and down for 0, new data will be input after the training of the model. Finally, the output data can be compared with the real data to judge the application effect of the model, after comparing e and analyzing the application effect of the model. The results show that the research in this study can help investors to build an automated investment model and the investment strategy of the stock market. The construction can be used for reference to improve investors' investment strategy and return rate.},

@article{dlt,
	abstract = {The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. `Systematic reviews' of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are `supplementary' technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of `technological systems' that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.},

Gasol offers a wide variety of cost models that allow inferring the gas consumption associated to selected types of EVM instructions and/or inferring the number of times that such types of bytecode instructions are executed. Among others, we have cost models to measure only storage opcodes, to measure a selected family of gas-consumption opcodes following the Ethereum's classification, to estimate the cost of a selected program line, etc. After choosing the desired cost model and the function of interest, Gasol returns to the user an upper bound of the cost for this function. As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions that access the storage, Gasol uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the selected function. Our tool can be used within an Eclipse plugin for Solidity which displays the gas and instructions bounds and, when applicable, the gas-optimized Solidity function.},

@inproceedings{kevm,
	abstract = {A developing field of interest for the distributed systems and applied cryptography communities is that of smart contracts: self-executing financial instruments that synchronize their state, often through a blockchain. One such smart contract system that has seen widespread practical adoption is Ethereum, which has grown to a market capacity of 100 billion USD and clears an excess of 500,000 daily transactions. Unfortunately, the rise of these technologies has been marred by a series of costly bugs and exploits. Increasingly, the Ethereum community has turned to formal methods and rigorous program analysis tools. This trend holds great promise due to the relative simplicity of smart contracts and bounded-time deterministic execution inherent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Here we present KEVM, an executable formal specification of the EVM's bytecode stack-based language built with the K Framework, designed to serve as a solid foundation for further formal analyses. We empirically evaluate the correctness and performance of KEVM using the official Ethereum test suite. To demonstrate the usability, several extensions of the semantics are presented. and two different-language implementations of the ERC20 Standard Token are verified against the ERC20 specification. These results are encouraging for the executable semantics approach to language prototyping and specification.},

@article{whitepaper-eth,
	abstract = {When Satoshi Nakamoto first set the Bitcoin blockchain into motion in January 2009, he was
simultaneously introducing two radical and untested concepts. The first is the "bitcoin", a decentralized
peer-to-peer online currency that maintains a value without any backing, intrinsic value or central issuer. So
far, the "bitcoin" as a currency unit has taken up the bulk of the public attention, both in terms of the political
aspects of a currency without a central bank and its extreme upward and downward volatility in price.
However, there is also another, equally important, part to Satoshi's grand experiment: the concept of a proof of
work-based blockchain to allow for public agreement on the order of transactions. Bitcoin as an application can
be described as a first-to-file system: if one entity has 50 BTC, and simultaneously sends the same 50 BTC to
A and to B, only the transaction that gets confirmed first will process. There is no intrinsic way of determining
from two transactions which came earlier, and for decades this stymied the development of decentralized
digital currency. Satoshi's blockchain was the first credible decentralized solution. And now, attention is
rapidly starting to shift toward this second part of Bitcoin's technology, and how the blockchain concept can be
used for more than just money.
Commonly cited applications include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and
financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"),
non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin") as well as more advanced applications such as
decentralized exchange, financial derivatives, peer-to-peer gambling and on-blockchain identity and
reputation systems. Another important area of inquiry is "smart contracts" - systems which automatically
move digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified rules. For example, one might have a treasury contract
of the form "A can withdraw up to X currency units per day, B can withdraw up to Y per day, A and B together
can withdraw anything, and A can shut off B's ability to withdraw". The logical extension of this is
decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) - long-term smart contracts that contain the assets and
encode the bylaws of an entire organization. What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in
fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used
to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as
well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

@article{query,
	abstract = {When, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned the first distributed database management system that relied on cryptographically secured chain of blocks to store data in an immutable and tamper-resistant manner, his primary use case was the introduction of a digital currency. Owing to this use case, the blockchain system was geared towards efficient storage of data, whereas the processing of complex queries, such as provenance analyses of data history, is out of focus. The increasing use of Internet of Things technologies and the resulting digitization in many domains, however, have led to a plethora of novel use cases for a secure digital ledger. For instance, in the healthcare sector, blockchain systems are used for the secure storage and sharing of electronic health records, while the food industry applies such systems to enable a reliable food-chain traceability, e.g., to prove compliance with cold chains. In these application domains, however, querying the current state is not sufficient&mdash;comprehensive history queries are required instead. Due to these altered usage modes involving more complex query types, it is questionable whether today&rsquo;s blockchain systems are prepared for this type of usage and whether such queries can be processed efficiently by them. In our paper, we therefore investigate novel use cases for blockchain systems and elicit their requirements towards a data store in terms of query capabilities. We reflect the state of the art in terms of query support in blockchain systems and assess whether it is capable of meeting the requirements of such more sophisticated use cases. As a result, we identify future research challenges with regard to query processing in blockchain systems.},

	abstract = {Blockchain-based decentralized cryptocurrencies have drawn much attention and been widely-deployed in recent years. Bitcoin, the first application of blockchain, achieves great success and promotes more development in this field. However, Bitcoin encounters performance problems of low throughput and high transaction latency. Other cryptocurrencies based on proof-of-work also inherit the flaws, leading to more concerns about the scalability of blockchain. This paper attempts to cover the existing scaling solutions for blockchain and classify them by level. In addition, we make comparisons between different methods and list some potential directions for solving the scalability problem of blockchain.},

@article{bitcoin-mining-elec,
	abstract = {After its introduction in 2008, increasing Bitcoin prices and a booming number of other cryptocurrencies lead to a growing discussion of how much energy is consumed during the production of these currencies. Being the most expensive and the most popular cryptocurrency, both the business world and the research community have started to question the energy intensity of Bitcoin mining. This paper only focuses on computational power demand during the proof-of-work process rather than estimating the whole energy intensity of mining. We make use of 160GB of Bitcoin blockchain data to estimate the energy consumption and power demand of Bitcoin mining. We considered the performance of 269 different hardware models (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC). For estimations, we defined two metrics, namely; minimum consumption and maximum consumption. The targeted time span for the analysis was from 3 January 2009 to 5 June 2018. We show that the historical peak of power consumption of Bitcoin mining took place during the bi-weekly period commencing on 18 December 2017 with a demand of between 1.3 and 14.8 GW. This maximum demand figure was between the installed capacities of Finland (∼16 GW) and Denmark (∼14 GW). We also show that, during June 2018, energy consumption of Bitcoin mining from difficulty recalculation was between 15.47 and 50.24 TWh per year.},

@article{fraud-detection,
	abstract = {Blockchain and Data Mining are not simply buzzwords, but rather concepts that are playing an important role in the modern Information Technology (IT) revolution. Blockchain has recently been popularized by the rise of cryptocurrencies, while data mining has already been present in IT for many decades. Data stored in a blockchain can also be considered to be big data, whereas data mining methods can be applied to extract knowledge hidden in the blockchain. In a nutshell, this paper presents the interplay of these two research areas. In this paper, we surveyed approaches for the data mining of blockchain data, yet show several real-world applications. Special attention was paid to anomaly detection and fraud detection, which were identified as the most prolific applications of applying data mining methods on blockchain data. The paper concludes with challenges for future investigations of this research area.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrency is a relatively new combination of cryptology and currency in financial areas and is increasingly frequently used worldwide. Blockchain applications are expected to reshape the renewable energy market. However, there is a lack of studies covering the power usage of digital currencies. Therefore, this study ran experiments on mining efficiency of nine kinds of cryptocurrencies and ten algorithms. A comparison of statistical analysis of data in a benchmark and experiment results of Monero mining was conducted. Thereafter, this study provided an estimation of global electricity consumption of the Monero mining activity. The results indicated that the hashing algorithm mainly determines the mining efficiency. Data analysis and experiments and estimated Monero mining electricity consumption in the world and its carbon emission in China as a case study. In 2018, Monero mining may consume 645.62 GWh of electricity in the world after its hard fork. The Monero mining in China may consume 30.34 GWh and contribute a carbon emission of 19.12--19.42 thousand tons from April to December in 2018. Although cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology are promising, their influence on energy conversation and sustainable development should be further studied.},

With blockchain as its basic technique, Bitcoin possesses strong security features which anonymizes user's identity to protect their private information. However, some criminals utilize Bitcoin to do several illegal activities bringing in great security threat to the society. Therefore, it is necessary to get knowledge of the current trend of Bitcoin and make effort to de-anonymize. In this paper, we put forward and realize a system to analyze Bitcoin from two aspects: blockchain data and network traffic data. We resolve the blockchain data to analyze Bitcoin from the point of Bitcoin address while simulate Bitcoin P2P protocol to evaluate Bitcoin from the point of IP address. At last, with our system, we finish analyzing its current trends and tracing its transactions by putting some statistics on Bitcoin transactions and addresses, tracing the transaction flow and de-anonymizing some Bitcoin addresses to IPs.},

Wash trade transactions are even more prominent in ERC20 cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we proposed two kinds of algorithms to reserve direct evidence of wash trade based on the on-chain transaction data of ERC20 cryptocurrencies. After labeling the wash trade, we continued to obtain features of the wash trade and quantify the volume of the wash trade. Our experiments show that for most ERC20 cryptocurrencies, the rate of wash trade reached over 15%. Specifically, over 30% of UNI token transactions ​were labeled as wash trade. It is demonstrated that the activations of most ERC20 cryptocurrencies are unreal, and restoring real data is necessary for market regulation.},

However, distrust, privacy concerns, data misuse, and the asymmetric valuation of shared data between entities often hinder data sharing. This problem calls for a secure, efficient, fair, and trustworthy data-sharing mechanism. The key to such a successful system hinges on how to trace the data usage, determine the value of the seller's data to the buyer and then compensate the seller accordingly. To this end, we design and implement a blockchain-enabled data-sharing marketplace for a stylized supply chain. We demonstrate how a blockchain can be used to overcome these impediments in supply-chain data sharing and provide a detailed tutorial with a step-by-step implementation for how to set up such a data exchange prototype using Hashgraph.},

However, there are a number of limitations in conventional data trading platforms due to the existence of dishonest buyer/data broker.

Specifically, in this paper, we introduce a secure data trading ecosystem and present a new blockchain-based data trading ecosystem (hereafter referred to as SDTE). In the ecosystem, both data broker and buyer are not able to obtain access to the seller's raw data, as they are only getting access to the analysis findings that they require. In other words, we reduce the challenge of securing the dataset to the challenge to secure the data processing. We also build a security model to analyze the data trading market and describe a new set of trading protocols for the entire data trading market. To demonstrate utility, we implement our proposed secure data trading platform (SDTP) on Ethereum & Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and perform an in-depth analysis.},

@article{digital-twin,
	abstract = {The concept of digital twin was originally proposed to assist product lifecycle management through the high-fidelity virtual product. In product lifecycle, there are many participators constructing a complicated network with enormous product lifecycle data. It is difficult to manage data of digital twin efficiently and securely from the perspectives of data storage, data access, data sharing, and data authenticity among the complicated network. Moreover, the virtual product is always updated to the latest state of the physical product by overwriting the history virtual product that records the development process of digital twin. To address abovementioned data management problems simultaneously, a data management method for digital twin of product based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. A peer-to-peer network is constructed to enhance data sharing efficiency among participators. The basic structure of blockchain is introduced, including block, chain, and transaction. The blockchain is used for data storage through cryptography that ensuring only eligible participators can access the corresponding data. The change sensitive characteristic of blockchain can ensure data authenticity as well. In addition, the concept of smart contract can be used to execute some actions automatically to increase data sharing efficiency. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data management method. The results show that the proposed method can solve the abovementioned data management problems simultaneously.},

The available frameworks of data integrity verification with public auditability cannot avoid the Third Party Auditors (TPAs). However, in a dynamic environment, such as the IoT, the reliability of the TPA-based frameworks is far from being satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework for Data Integrity Service. Under such framework, a more reliable data integrity verification can be provided for both the Data Owners and the Data Consumers, without relying on any Third Party Auditor (TPA). In this paper, the relevant protocols and a subsequent prototype system, which is implemented to evaluate the feasibility of our proposals, are presented. The performance evaluation of the implemented prototype system is conducted, and the test results are discussed.

	abstract = {Blockchain has recently attracted tremendous interest due to its ability to enhance security and privacy through a immutable shared distributed ledger. Blockchain's ability to detect integrity violations are particularly key in providing assured data provenance in cloud platform. The practical adoption of blockchain will largely hinge on consensus protocols meeting performance and security guarantees. In this paper, we present the design issues for consensus protocols for blockchain based cloud provenance. We present the blockchain based data provenance framework for cloud. We find that there are performance and security challenges in adopting proof-of-work consensus protocol within this framework. We present unique design challenges and opportunities in developing proof-of-stake for data provenance in cloud platform.},
