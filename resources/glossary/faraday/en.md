A tool developed by Lightning Labs designed to extract data from an LND node and analyze it to assist its operator. It offers recommendations for closing underperforming channels and provides detailed information on the node's routing behavior. Faraday helps to identify low-volume channels and those with availability (uptime) issues. This tool aims to assist node operators in allocating their capital in their channels.
