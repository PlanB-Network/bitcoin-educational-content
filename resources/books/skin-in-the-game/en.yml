  Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a book that explores
  the concept of having a personal stake in any decision, business, or enterprise
  one engages in. Taleb argues that individuals, businesses, and governments should be held accountable for the risks they take, and that the lack of personal risk-taking has led to many of the world''s problems, from the financial crisis to political   corruption. Through real-world examples and thought-provoking anecdotes, Taleb encourages readers to embrace the idea of "skin in the game" and take ownership of their actions and decisions, ultimately leading to greater success and prosperity.'
