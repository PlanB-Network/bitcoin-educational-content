term: PAYNYM
---

A unique identifier linked to a Bitcoin wallet that implements this option. Paynyms are available on Samourai Wallet and Sparrow Wallet. Originally, these identifiers are generated from the wallet's payment code, in accordance with BIP47. They thus offer the possibility to connect with another user in order to generate clean and unique receiving addresses, without requiring direct interaction. The use of Paynyms was later expanded to support various other features of the Samourai ecosystem. They are notably used to enable encrypted exchanges on the Soroban communication protocol, in order to easily implement collaborative transactions. Paynyms can also be used for authentication on systems compatible with the AUTH47 protocol. Each Paynym is characterized by a unique identifier and is represented by a robot illustration.
