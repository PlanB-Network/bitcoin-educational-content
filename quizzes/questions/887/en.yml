question: What is the relationship between time preference and interest rates in an
  economy with unmanipulated capital markets?
answer: An increase in interest rates results from a relative increase in demand for
  capital compared to supply, indicating higher time preferences. Conversely, a decrease
  in interest rates occurs due to an increase in savings, which is an increase in
  the supply of capital, indicating a reduction in time preferences.
wrong_answers:
  - An increase in interest rates indicates a decrease in time preferences, while
    a decrease in interest rates indicates an increase in time preferences.
  - Time preference and interest rates are inversely related.
  - Time preference and interest rates have no direct relationship.
explanation: |
  In an economy with unmanipulated capital markets, reference interest
  rates are determined at the intersection of capital supply and demand. Therefore,
  these rates represent the state of time preferences for the entire economy. An increase
  in the interest rate results from a relative increase in demand for capital compared
  to supply, indicating higher time preferences. Conversely, a decrease in interest
  rates occurs due to an increase in savings, which is an increase in the supply of
  capital, indicating a reduction in time preferences.
