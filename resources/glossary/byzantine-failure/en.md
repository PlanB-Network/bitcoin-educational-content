term: BYZANTINE FAILURE
---

Byzantine failure, or Byzantine behavior, refers to any behavior of a system that does not comply with its own specifications, producing non-conforming results.

"Natural Byzantine failures" are commonly distinguished from "deliberate Byzantine failures": the former generally stem from undetected physical errors (memory, network transmissions, etc.), while the latter are mainly the result of attacks aimed at causing the system to fail (sabotage, malice, backdoor).

Authentication, signing, and consensus through cryptographic means and "Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)" algorithms help to mitigate these issues.
