term: SOFT FORK
---

Modification of the protocol rules in a backward-compatible way. Unlike a hard fork, a soft fork does not result in the division of the Bitcoin network's nodes into two distinct groups, provided that a majority of the computing power is on the updated chain. If everything goes well, nodes with the update and nodes without the update remain on the same blockchain. A modification is backward-compatible when it adds or makes certain protocol rules more restrictive.
