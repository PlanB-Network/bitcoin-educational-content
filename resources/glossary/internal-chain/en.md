term: INTERNAL CHAIN
---

In the derivation of deterministic and hierarchical wallets, the internal chain is a derivation branch used to generate receiving addresses intended to receive payments from the same wallet, that is, only change addresses. Each account as defined at depth 3 has two chains at depth 4: an external chain and an internal chain (also called "change chain"). The internal chain is derived with an index of `/1/`.
