term: CONSENSUS
---

Mechanism by which all nodes in the Bitcoin network come to agree on the shared state of the blockchain. Consensus ensures that all users align on the same history of Bitcoin transactions, notably to prevent double spending. The consensus mechanism of Bitcoin is sometimes referred to as "Nakamoto Consensus". It relies on proof of work and specifies that all network nodes accept the chain with the greatest amount of accumulated work.
