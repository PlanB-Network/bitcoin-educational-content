term: GETWORK
---

GETWORK was an old mining protocol for Bitcoin created in 2010 by m0mchil. It allowed miners to receive work data from a full node. It was based on RPC requests that enabled obtaining block headers to work on in order to find a valid proof of work. GETWORK was optimized for GPU mining. It was the first open-source software designed to optimize communication between nodes and miners at a time when a few players kept such software private. GETWORK was gradually replaced by Stratum, which is more efficient, especially for ASICs, and less bandwidth-intensive.
