  Bitcoin is the future of money, that is my firm belief. I use this show to learn more about this phenomenon, and its various implications, from some of the brightest minds in the space, and beyond. I'm not trying to educate or inform anyone, I'm sharing my own journey of attempting to understand bitcoin, and delving in to some of the less obvious, but incredibly profound, aspects of its emergence in the global culture.
