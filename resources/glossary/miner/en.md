term: MINER
---

In the context of mining pools, participants are often referred to as "miners." These individual miners have the primary task of hashing block templates provided by the pool server, looking for hashes that meet the target difficulty set for shares, and not the one for Bitcoin. The rest of the mining process, which includes the actual construction of blocks, the selection of transactions, or the search for proof of work according to Bitcoin's own difficulty, is carried out directly by the pools.
