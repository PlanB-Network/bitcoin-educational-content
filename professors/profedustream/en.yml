bio: |
  Welcome to PlanB.network! I'm Thomas, a.k.a. @ProfEduStream, and I first became interested in Bitcoin through mining. Subsequently, having familiarized myself with data analysis and Python, I quickly became interested in on-chain analysis; particularly in the analysis of transactions from blocks 1 to 210000. In 2023, I began writing articles titled "Bitcoin Blockchain Fun Facts" on my Substack.
  In parallel, as a teacher, I have a deep passion for sharing my knowledge. This is why I co-created the Bitcoin Lille association in France, with which we hold a weekly meet-up. There, I regularly give presentations, both technical and simplified, which are all available open-source on YouTube and my Substack.
  Finally, I try to bring together communities, both French and international. Because together, we will go much further, much faster.
