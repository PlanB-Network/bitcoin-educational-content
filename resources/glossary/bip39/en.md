term: BIP39
---

BIP39 introduces a method for converting a wallet's random seed into a sequence of words that are memorable and human-readable, known as a mnemonic phrase. This phrase, typically consisting of 12 or 24 words, allows for the deterministic regeneration of all the private keys in a wallet. Thus, instead of having to memorize or store a complex cryptographic seed, users can back up their bitcoins with a phrase of a few words. BIP39 has thus contributed to simplifying the management of a Bitcoin wallet.
