term: THE DAO
---

Project launched in 2016 on Ethereum, aimed at creating an autonomous investment fund managed by smart contracts. Although primarily associated with Ethereum, The DAO had a significant impact on the evolution of Bitcoin. In June 2016, The DAO was the victim of a massive hack. In response, the Ethereum community executed a hardfork, which turned out to be a resounding failure. This incident solidified the conservative positions of the small blockers during the Bitcoin Blocksize War. They used this event to argue against rapid changes in the Bitcoin protocol, as advocated by the big blockers, and against the idea of performing hardforks, as was the case on Ethereum following The DAO hack.
