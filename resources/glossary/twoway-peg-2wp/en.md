term: TWO-WAY PEG (2WP)
---

A mechanism that establishes a connection between the main Bitcoin system and a sidechain (or a drivechain), which is a lateral chain. The 2WP ensures a fixed value correlation between bitcoins on the main blockchain and the corresponding assets on the sidechain, thereby allowing the movement of bitcoins between the two chains. To do this, bitcoins are temporarily locked on the main blockchain, and an equivalent amount of assets is issued on the sidechain. This allows users to take advantage of specific benefits of the sidechain, such as faster transactions or enhanced privacy features, while maintaining the value of the bitcoins used. When users wish to return to the Bitcoin blockchain, the process is reversed: the assets on the sidechain are destroyed, and the corresponding bitcoins are unlocked. There are many different two-way peg mechanisms that can rely on:
* A single trusted third party;
* A federation of entities (as on Liquid);
* The miners of the main chain (*drivechain*).
