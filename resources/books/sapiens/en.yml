  Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is a fascinating look at the history of humankind. Harari examines the evolution of Homo sapiens from our earliest days as hunter-gatherers through the agricultural revolution and the development of modern civilization. He explores the ways in which we have adapted and changed over time, and the impact that we have had on the world around us. Through his detailed and thought-provoking analysis, Harari challenges us to think about our place in the world and the choices that we make as a species. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in history, anthropology, or the human condition.'
