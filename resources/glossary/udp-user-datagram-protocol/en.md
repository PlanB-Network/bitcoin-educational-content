term: UDP (USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL)
---

A communication protocol used on the Internet that allows the sending of messages (datagrams) between computers without establishing a prior connection (unlike TCP). UDP is a method of fast transfer, but without guarantees of delivery, packet order, or error management. It is used primarily for applications requiring rapid and real-time broadcasting. This protocol was utilized within the FIBRE project (*Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine*) to accelerate the propagation of Bitcoin blocks.
