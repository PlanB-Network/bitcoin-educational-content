term: SHOR (ALGORITHM)
---

Quantum algorithm invented in 1994 by Peter Shor that allows for the factorization of large integers into a product of prime numbers in polynomial time. By reducing the number of operations needed to factorize integers, Shor could render impractical the cryptography algorithms established on this mathematical problem, such as RSA. Shor can be slightly modified to act on almost all algorithms that use a group structure. It notably already has an efficient variant on elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, Schnorr...). Therefore, Shor and its close variants are effective on asymmetric cryptography algorithms. Currently, we do not yet have a quantum computer that is sufficiently powerful and stable to successfully execute Shor's algorithm.
