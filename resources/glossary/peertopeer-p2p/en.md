term: PEER-TO-PEER (P2P)
---

Refers to a model of communication and data distribution in which participants, often called nodes or peers, share their resources (such as files, processing power, bandwidth, assets...) directly among themselves, without the need for a centralized intermediary. In a P2P system, each participant acts simultaneously as a client (consumer of resources) and a server (provider of resources).

The Bitcoin system operates on a P2P model, where nodes are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain. This means that, unlike traditional banking systems which rely on centralized entities, Bitcoin operates on a distributed structure where no single entity holds control. The nodes in the Bitcoin network communicate with each other to broadcast transactions and blocks, and to find a consensus on the state of the ledger.
