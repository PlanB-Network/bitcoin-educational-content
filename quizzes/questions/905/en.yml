question: What is the main argument of Ludwig von Mises in his article "Economic Calculation in a Socialist Commonwealth"?
answer: Rational economic organization is impossible without prices for the intermediate
  factors of production.
wrong_answers:
  - Socialism is morally superior to capitalism.
  - Capitalism is the only viable economic system.
  - Socialism can produce individuals devoid of capitalist instincts.
explanation: |
  Mises argued that without a market to determine prices for intermediate
  factors of production, it becomes impossible to rationalize the use of resources
  across industries. This means that even if there is perfect organization within
  each firm or subpart of the economy, the entire economy cannot efficiently adjust
  to changes in resource availability, production conditions, and consumer preferences.
