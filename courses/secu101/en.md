## Choosing the Web Browser

### Common Errors When Browsing the Internet and How to Avoid Them

When browsing the internet, it is important to avoid certain common errors to preserve your online security. Here are some tips to avoid them:

- Error related to software downloads: It is recommended to download software from the official website of the publisher rather than generic sites. It is also advisable to prioritize open-source and free software, as they are often safer and free from malicious software.
- Error related to web browsers: There are two main families of browsers, those based on Chrome and those based on Firefox. Although both browser families offer a similar level of security, it is advisable to avoid Google Chrome browser due to its trackers. Lighter alternatives to Chrome, such as Chromium or Brave, may be preferred. It may be necessary to use different browsers to access certain sites. The use of the Brave browser may be recommended due to its built-in ad blocker. It is also important to limit the number of installed extensions to avoid security and performance issues.
- Error related to cookie management: Cookies are files created by websites to store information on your device. Some sites require the use of cookies to function properly, however, it is important to note that cookies can also be shared with third-party sites for advertising tracking purposes. According to regulations such as the GDPR, it is possible to refuse third-party tracking cookies. It is recommended to only accept cookies necessary for the proper functioning of the site and to delete cookies once you have left the site, using an extension or a dedicated cookie management program.

### Web browsers: choices, security, and cookie management

We have already mentioned that browsers based on Chrome and Firefox offer a similar level of security, but it is recommended to avoid Google Chrome browser due to its trackers. It may be necessary to use multiple browsers to access certain sites, and Brave may be preferred for its built-in ad blocker.

Regarding cookie management, it is important to refuse third-party tracking cookies while accepting cookies necessary for the site's functionality. After leaving a site, it is advisable to delete the cookies associated with it using an extension or a dedicated program.

Some browsers allow for selective deletion of cookies or sessions. However, it is important to find the right balance between convenience, ease of use, and security. It should be noted that even if you delete cookies, it is possible that the information collected by cookies from different sites may still be interconnected.

By keeping these recommendations in mind for browser choices, cookie management, and online security, you will be able to browse the internet more safely and protect your privacy.

### Private browsing, TOR, and other alternatives for safer and anonymous browsing

Private browsing, although it does not hide your browsing from your internet service provider, allows you to leave no local traces on your computer. Cookies are automatically deleted at the end of each session, allowing you to accept all cookies without being tracked. Private browsing can be useful when purchasing online services, as websites track our search habits and adjust prices accordingly. However, it is important to note that private browsing is recommended for temporary and specific sessions, not for general internet browsing.

A more advanced alternative is the TOR (The Onion Router) network, which offers anonymity by masking the user's IP address and allowing access to the Darknet. TOR Browser is a browser specifically designed to use the TOR network. It allows you to visit both conventional websites and .onion websites, which are typically operated by individuals and may be illegal in nature.

TOR is legal and is used by journalists, freedom activists, and others wishing to bypass censorship in authoritarian countries. However, it is important to understand that TOR does not secure the visited sites or the computer itself. Additionally, using TOR can slow down internet connection as data passes through three other people's computers before reaching its destination. It is also essential to note that TOR is not a foolproof solution to guarantee 100% anonymity and should not be used for illegal activities.

# VPN and Internet Connection

![vpn and internet connection](https://youtu.be/oRO7sGexvzo)

## Using the Internet Safely

### VPNs

Digital hygiene is a crucial aspect of online security, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) is an effective method to enhance this security, both for businesses and individual users.

VPNs are tools that encrypt the data transmitted over the internet, making the connection more secure. In a professional context, VPNs allow employees to securely access the internal network of the company remotely. The exchanged data is encrypted, making it much more difficult for third parties to intercept. In addition to securing access to an internal network, using a VPN can allow a user to route their internet connection through the company's internal network, giving the impression that their connection is coming from the company. This can be particularly useful for accessing online services that are geographically restricted.
There are two main types of VPN: enterprise VPNs and consumer VPNs, such as NordVPN. Enterprise VPNs tend to be more expensive and complex, while consumer VPNs are generally more accessible and easy to use. For example, NordVPN allows users to connect to the internet through a server located in another country, which can bypass geographical restrictions.

However, using a consumer VPN does not guarantee complete anonymity. Many VPN providers retain information about their users, which can potentially compromise their anonymity. Although VPNs can be useful for improving online security, they are not a universal solution. They are effective for specific uses, such as accessing geographically limited services or enhancing security while traveling, but they do not guarantee total security. When choosing a VPN, it is essential to prioritize reliability and technicality over popularity. VPN providers that collect the least personal information are generally the safest. Services like iVPN and Mulvad do not collect personal information and even allow payments in Bitcoin for increased privacy.

Finally, a VPN can also be used to block online advertisements, providing a more enjoyable and secure browsing experience. However, it is important to do your own research to find the VPN that best suits your specific needs. In terms of online security, it is essential to understand that 4G is generally more secure than public Wi-Fi. However, using 4G can quickly deplete your mobile data plan. The HTTPS protocol has become the standard for encrypting data on websites. It ensures that the data exchanged between the user and the website is secure. Therefore, it is crucial to verify that the site you are visiting uses the HTTPS protocol.
In the European Union, data protection is regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, it is safer to use European Wi-Fi access providers, such as SNCF, who do not resell user connection data. However, the mere presence of a padlock on a website does not guarantee its authenticity. It is important to verify the site's public key using a certificate system to confirm its authenticity. Although data encryption prevents third parties from intercepting exchanged data, it is still possible for a malicious individual to impersonate the site and transfer data in plain text.

To avoid online scams, it is crucial to verify the identity of the site you are browsing, especially by checking the extension and domain name. Additionally, be cautious of scammers who use similar letters in URLs to deceive users.

The use of a VPN is recommended to enhance security, even when browsing the internet at home. This helps ensure a higher level of security for exchanged data online. Finally, make sure to check the URLs and the small padlock in the address bar to confirm that you are on the site you intend to visit.

In summary, the use of VPNs can greatly improve online security for both businesses and individual users. Furthermore, practicing good browsing habits can contribute to better digital hygiene. In the next segment of this course, we will discuss computer security, including updates, antivirus software, and password management.

# Computer Usage

![computer usage](https://youtu.be/lzJr5CIulSU)

## Best Practices for Usage

The security of our computers is a major concern in today's digital world. Today, we will address three key points: choosing a computer, updates and antivirus for optimal security, and finally, best practices for the security of your computer and data.

When it comes to choosing a computer, there is no significant difference in security between old and new computers. However, security differences exist between operating systems: Windows, Linux, and Mac. It is recommended not to use an administrator account on a daily basis, but rather to create two separate accounts: an administrator account and a daily use account. Windows is often more vulnerable to malware due to its large number of users and the ease of switching from user to administrator. On the other hand, threats are less common on Linux and Mac.
The choice of operating system should be made based on your needs and preferences. Linux systems have evolved considerably in recent years, becoming more and more user-friendly. Ubuntu is an interesting alternative for beginners, with an easy-to-use graphical interface. It is possible to partition a computer to experiment with Linux while keeping Windows, but this can be complex. It is often preferable to have a dedicated computer, a virtual machine, or a USB key to test Linux or Ubuntu.

Regarding updates and antivirus for optimal security, regular updates of the operating system and applications are essential. On Windows 10, updates are almost continuous and it is crucial not to block or delay them. Each year, about 15,000 vulnerabilities are identified, highlighting the importance of keeping software up to date to protect against viruses. In general, software support ends between 3 and 5 years after its release, so it is necessary to upgrade to the higher version to continue benefiting from security.

Windows Defender, the built-in antivirus in Windows, is a safe and effective solution. It is important to be cautious with antivirus downloaded from the internet, as they can be malicious or outdated. Linux and Mac, thanks to their user rights separation system, often do not need antivirus. For those who wish to invest in a paid antivirus, it is recommended to choose one that intelligently analyzes unknown and emerging threats, such as Kaspersky. Antivirus updates are essential to protect against new threats.

Finally, here are some good practices for the security of your computer and data. It is important to choose an effective and user-friendly antivirus. It is also crucial to adopt good practices on your computer, such as not inserting unknown or found USB keys in suspicious places. These USB keys can contain malicious programs that can automatically launch upon insertion. Checking the USB key will be useless once it has been inserted. Some companies have been victims of hacking due to USB keys carelessly left in accessible areas, such as a parking lot.

Treat your computer like you would treat your home: stay vigilant, perform regular updates, delete unnecessary files, and use a strong password for security. It is crucial to encrypt data on laptops and smartphones to prevent theft or data loss. BitLocker for Windows, Lux for Linux, and the built-in option for Mac are solutions for data encryption. It is recommended to activate data encryption without hesitation and to write down the password on a paper to keep it safe.

In conclusion, it is essential to choose an operating system that suits your needs and regularly update it, as well as the installed applications. It is also important to use an effective and user-friendly antivirus and adopt good practices for the security of your computer and data.

# Hacking & Backup Management: Protecting Your Data

![hacking and backup management](https://youtu.be/CJDjWPV3PeU)

## Cybersecurity and Prevention

Phishing, vigilance against fraudulent emails:
Stay alert to phishing attempts aimed at extracting sensitive information such as your credentials and passwords. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and sharing your personal information without verifying the legitimacy of the sender.

Caution with attachments and images in emails:
Attachments and images in emails can contain malicious software. Do not download or open attachments from unknown or suspicious senders, and make sure your antivirus is up to date.

Ransomware and types of cyber attacks:
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts user data and demands a ransom to decrypt it. Learn about different types of cyber attacks and take measures to protect your system and data.

Response in case of virus detection:
If you detect a virus on your computer, disconnect it from the internet, perform a full antivirus scan, and delete infected files. Then, update your software and operating system, and change your passwords to prevent further intrusions.

## Data Backup

Regularly back up your important data to an external storage or secure online storage service. This way, in case of a cyber attack or hardware failure, you can recover your data without losing crucial information.

Paying hackers, a bad idea: It is generally not recommended to pay hackers in case of ransomware or other types of attacks. Paying the ransom does not guarantee the recovery of your data and can encourage cybercriminals to continue their malicious activities. Instead, prioritize prevention and regular backup of your data to protect yourself.

# Managing email

![Managing email](https://youtu.be/WjqH882f4cY)

In this section, we will cover three essential topics to ensure the security of online access: email management, using a password manager, and two-factor authentication (2FA).

### Choosing an email provider and managing email addresses

Proper management of our email addresses is crucial to ensure the security of our online access. It is important to choose a secure and privacy-respecting email provider. For example, ProtonMail is a secure and privacy-respecting email service.

When choosing an email provider and creating a password, it is essential to never reuse the same password for different online services. It is recommended to regularly create new email addresses and separate uses by using different email addresses. It is preferable to opt for a secure email service for critical accounts. It should also be noted that some services limit the length of passwords, so it is important to be aware of this limitation. Services are also available for creating temporary email addresses, which can be used for limited-duration accounts.

It is important to consider that older email providers such as La Poste, Arobase, Wig, Hotmail, are still used, but their security practices may be less good than those of Gmail. Therefore, it is recommended to have two separate email addresses, one for general communications and the other for account recovery, with the latter being better secured. It is best to avoid mixing the email address with your telephone operator or internet service provider, as this can be an attack vector.

Securing email addresses and using Have I Been Pwned to check for data breaches

It is advisable to use the Have I Been Pwned website to check if our email address has been compromised and to be alerted to future data breaches. A hacked database can be exploited by hackers to send phishing emails or reuse compromised passwords.
The Have I Been Pwned website allows you to check if your email address has been compromised without directly disclosing that address. It is therefore recommended to create a second email address for additional security purposes. Emails are a means of communication that should continue to be used for a long time. However, it is crucial to secure our passwords and implement two-factor authentication to enhance the security of our email accounts.

# Password Manager

![password manager](https://youtu.be/HzLuZ6noePY)

To ensure the security of your account, it is crucial to create strong and secure passwords. The length of the password is not sufficient to ensure its security. The characters must be completely random in order to resist brute force attacks. The independence of events is also important to avoid the most likely combinations. Common passwords such as "password" are easily compromised.

To create a strong password, it is recommended to use a large number of random characters, without using predictable words or patterns. It is also essential to include numbers and special characters. However, it should be noted that some sites may restrict the use of certain special characters. Passwords that are not randomly generated are easy to guess. Variations or additions to passwords are not secure. Websites cannot guarantee the security of passwords chosen by users.

Randomly generated passwords offer a higher level of security, although they may be more difficult to remember. Password managers can generate more secure random passwords. By using a password manager, you do not need to memorize all your passwords. It is important to gradually replace your old passwords with those generated by the manager, as they are stronger and longer. Make sure that the master password of your password manager is also strong and secure.

## How to work in this industry

![conclusion and working in the industry](https://youtu.be/YZ2EKaPvoZU)

## Interview with Renaud

![Interview](https://youtu.be/RVjE-KOSKDs)

### Efficient password management and authentication reinforcement: an academic approach

In the training module "Security 101" offered by Découvre Bitcoin within the Academy, we discussed the importance of password managers. Three dimensions are essential to consider: creation, updating, and implementing passwords on websites.
It is generally not recommended to use browser extensions for automatic password filling. These tools can make the user more vulnerable to phishing attacks. Renaud, a recognized expert in cybersecurity, prefers manual management via KeePass, which involves manually copying and pasting the password. Extensions tend to increase the attack surface, can slow down browser performance, and therefore present a significant risk. Thus, minimal use of extensions on the browser is a recommended practice.

Password managers generally encourage the use of additional authentication factors, such as two-factor authentication. For optimal security, it is advisable to keep OTPs (One-Time Passwords) on your mobile device. AndoTP offers an open-source solution for generating and storing OTP codes on your phone. While Google Authenticator allows exporting authentication code seeds, trust in backup on a Google account remains limited. Therefore, the OTI and AndoTP applications are recommended for autonomous OTP management.

The question of digital inheritance and digital mourning raises the importance of having a procedure to transmit passwords after a person's death. A password manager facilitates this transition by securely storing all digital secrets in one place. The password manager also allows for identifying all open accounts and managing their closure or transfer. It is recommended to write down the master password on paper, but it should be kept in a concealed and secure location. If the hard drive is encrypted and the computer is locked, the password will not be accessible, even in the event of a burglary.

### Towards a post-password era: exploring credible alternatives

Passwords, although ubiquitous, have many disadvantages, including the possibility of risky transmission during the authentication process. Leading companies like Microsoft and Apple offer innovative alternatives such as biometrics and hardware tokens, indicating a progressive trend towards abandoning passwords.
'Passkeys, for example, offers encrypted random keys, combined with a local factor (biometrics or PIN), which are hosted by a provider but remain out of their reach. Although this requires updating websites, the approach eliminates the need for passwords, thus providing a high level of security without the constraints associated with traditional passwords or the issue of managing a digital safe.

Passkiz is another viable and secure alternative for password management. However, a major question remains: the availability in case of provider failure. It would therefore be desirable for internet giants to propose systems to guarantee this availability.

Direct authentication to the relevant service is an interesting option to no longer depend on a third party. However, Single Sign-On (SSO) offered by internet giants also poses problems in terms of availability and risks of censorship. In order to prevent data leaks, it is crucial to minimize the amount of information collected during the authentication process.

### Computer security: imperatives of safe practices and risks related to human negligence

Computer security can be compromised by simple practices and the use of default passwords, such as "admin". Sophisticated attacks are not always necessary to jeopardize computer security. For example, the administrator passwords of a YouTube channel were written in a company's private source code. Security vulnerabilities are often the result of human negligence.

It should also be noted that the Internet is highly centralized and largely under American control. The DNS server can be subject to censorship and often employs deceptive DNS to block access to certain sites. DNS is an old and insufficiently secure protocol, which can lead to security issues. New protocols, such as DNSsec, have emerged but are still not widely used. To bypass censorship and ad blocking, it is possible to choose alternative DNS providers.'
Alternatives to intrusive advertisements include Google DNS, OpenDNS, and other independent services. The standard DNS protocol leaves DNS queries visible to the internet service provider. DOH (DNS over HTTPS) and DOT (DNS over TLS) encrypt the DNS connection, providing greater privacy and security. These protocols are widely used in enterprises due to their enhanced security and are natively supported by Windows, Android, and iPhone. To use DOH and DOT, a TLS hostname must be entered instead of an IP address. Free DOH and DOT providers are available online. DOH and DOT improve privacy and security by avoiding "man in the middle" attacks.

Other key considerations

As part of the "Security 101" training module on Découvre Bitcoin Academy, we also discussed Lightning authentication. This system generates a different identifier for each service, without the need to provide an email address or personal information. It is possible to have user-controlled decentralized identities, but there is a lack of standardization and normalization in decentralized identity projects. Package managers such as Nuget and Chocolaté, which allow downloading open-source software outside of the Microsoft Store, are recommended to avoid malicious attacks. In summary, DNS is crucial for online security, but it is necessary to remain vigilant against potential attacks on DNS servers.
