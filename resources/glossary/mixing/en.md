term: MIXING
---

In the general field of mathematics, mixing or blending refers to the property of a dynamic system where, after a certain time, all portions of the initial space can theoretically become intermingled with any other portion. Mixing implies that the position of a particle or the state of a system evolves in such a way that its future distribution is independent of its initial distribution, thus reaching a state where the characteristics of the initial state are uniformly distributed throughout the system's space. In the context of Bitcoin, this notion can be used to assess the quality of a coin mixing process like a coinjoin.

> ► *In English, we talk about "mixing". Some bitcoiners differentiate the notion of mixing from the process of coinjoin. Indeed, they say that mixing refers to the blending of coins performed by an entity owning the funds, as opposed to coinjoins where the user always retains possession of the funds. However, in my opinion, this distinction is incorrect, because coinjoin necessarily involves mixing in the mathematical sense of the term.md#coinjoin)***
