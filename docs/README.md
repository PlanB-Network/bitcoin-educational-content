## Purpose

The PlanB Content Repo is designed to serve as a centralised hub for high-quality educational resources related to Bitcoin. Its key objectives include:

- Facilitating understanding and adoption of Bitcoin technology.
- Providing access to a wide range of educational materials, software, and hardware recommendations.
- Enabling contribution and collaboration from a diverse community of users and developers.
- Breaking down language barriers to ensure accessibility and inclusivity. For a list of supported languages, refer to the [Supported Languages](#supported-languages) section below.

## Supported Languages

Thanks to our contributors, the PlanB content is available in many languages and we are able to add new languages around the clock!

To see which languages are already available, just browse our [website](https://planb.network) and switch to your preferred language.

If you want to contribute to any existing content by proofreading it to improve translation quality or you want to add a missing language, please read our [Readme file](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content?tab=readme-ov-file#how-can-you-contribute) dedicated section, have a look to our [Content Translation & Proofreading Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/PlanB-Network/projects/3) and engage with us in the [Telegram Content Builder Group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder)

As we believe in the [value-4-value model](./value-4-value-model.md), we are always looking for contributors that are willing to review content in exchange of some sats (and knowledge).
