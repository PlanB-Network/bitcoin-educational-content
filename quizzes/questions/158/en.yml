question: What is the Byzantine Generals' Problem and how does Bitcoin solve it?
answer: It's a problem of coordinating information in a system where the various actors
  cannot be trusted. Bitcoin solves it through the use of a blockchain based on Proof
  of Work with a floating difficulty.
wrong_answers:
  - It's a problem of verifying transactions in a decentralized network. Bitcoin solves
    it through the use of digital signatures.
  - It's a problem of preventing double spending in a digital currency. Bitcoin solves
    it through the use of a public ledger.
  - It's a problem of maintaining consensus in a decentralized network. Bitcoin solves
    it through the use of a Proof of Stake algorithm.
explanation: >-
  The Byzantine Generals' Problem is a classic problem in distributed
  computing,
  which involves achieving consensus in a network where some of the nodes may be faulty
  or malicious. Bitcoin solves this problem through the use of a blockchain based
  on Proof of Work, which ensures that all nodes agree on the state of the transaction
  history.
