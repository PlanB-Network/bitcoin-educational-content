term: CASHU
---

An open-source protocol for Chaumian digital currency, similar to David Chaum's eCash system, but operating on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Specifically, Cashu is inspired by a variant of eCash proposed in 1996 by David Wagner named "*Chaumian ecash without RSA*". Cashu can be used on custodial wallets so that the server cannot identify either the owners of the funds or the details of the transactions, thereby offering an improvement in privacy. Users can generate Cashu tokens in exchange for bitcoins, which are signed by the server without knowing the user. The tokens can then be transferred between users instantly, privately, and without any fees.
