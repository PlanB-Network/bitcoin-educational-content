# Introduction 

We are currently working on a complete image translation workflow to automate the process as much as possible.

At the moment we follow this rules:

- If the image doesn't need to be translated: put it into the */assets/notext/* subfolder

- if an image needs to be translated, throughout all translations, put the image with the same filename into the related language subfolder. E.g. assets/fr/1.webp for French image, assets/en/1.webp for the English one and so on. This makes the replacement in the md file easier.
