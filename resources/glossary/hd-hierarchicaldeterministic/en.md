term: HD (HIERARCHICAL-DETERMINISTIC)
---

Refers to a Bitcoin wallet that uses a unique piece of information (the seed) to generate a multitude of public and private key pairs in a sequential and reproducible manner. This method of managing keys is defined by the BIP32 standard. The main advantage of HD wallets is that they allow users to have a multitude of different key pairs, notably to avoid address reuse, while being able to regenerate all of them from a single piece of information. This structure is described as hierarchical because it enables the creation of a tree-like organization of multiple keys and addresses from a single seed. And it is deterministic in the sense that each seed always generates the same sequence of keys in any wallet that conforms to this system.
