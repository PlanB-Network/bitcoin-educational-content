PlanB's mission is to provide top-tier educational resources on Bitcoin in as many languages as possible. All content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, allowing anyone to participate in enriching the platform.

Are you looking to add a Bitcoin podcast to the PlanB Network site and increase visibility for your show, but don't know how? This tutorial is for you!

- First, you need to have a GitHub account. If you don't know how to create one, we have made a detailed tutorial to guide you.

https://planb.network/tutorials/others/create-github-account


- Go to [the GitHub repository of PlanB dedicated to data](https://github.com/DecouvreBitcoin/sovereign-university-data/tree/dev/resources/podcasts) in the `resources/podcasts/` section:
![podcast](assets/02.webp)
- Click on the top right on the `Add file` button, then on `Create new file`:
![podcast](assets/03.webp)
- If you have never contributed to the content of PlanB Network before, you will need to create your fork of the original repository. Forking a repository means creating a copy of that repository on your own GitHub account, allowing you to work on the project without affecting the original repository. Click on the `Fork this repository` button:
![podcast](assets/04.webp)
- You will then arrive at the GitHub editing page:
![podcast](assets/05.webp)
- Create a folder for your podcast. To do this, in the `Name your file...` box, write the name of your podcast in lowercase with dashes instead of spaces. For example, if your show is called "Super Podcast Bitcoin", you should write `super-podcast-bitcoin`:
![podcast](assets/06.webp)
- To validate the creation of the folder, simply add a slash after your podcast name in the same box, for example: `super-podcast-bitcoin/`. Adding a slash automatically creates a folder rather than a file:
![podcast](assets/07.webp)
- In this folder, you will create a first YAML file named `podcast.yml`:
![podcast](assets/08.webp)
- Fill in this file with information about your podcast using this template:

```yaml
name: 
host: 
language: 
links:
  podcast: 
  twitter: 
  website: 
description: |
  
tags:
  - 
  - 
contributors:
  - 
```

Here are the details to fill in for each field:

- **`name`**: Indicate the name of your podcast.
- **`host`**: List the names or pseudonyms of the speakers or the host of the podcast. Each name should be separated by a comma.
- **`language`**: Indicate the language code of the language spoken in your podcast. For example, for English, note `en`, for Italian `it`...

- **`links`**: Provide links to your content. You have two options:
	- `podcast`: the link to your podcast,
	- `twitter`: the link to the Twitter profile of the podcast or the organization producing it,
	- `website`: the link to the website of the podcast or the organization producing it.

- **`description`**: Add a short paragraph that describes your podcast. The description must be in the same language as indicated in the `language:` field.

- **`tags`**: Add two tags associated with your podcast. Examples:
    - `bitcoin`
    - `technology`
    - `economy`
    - `education`...

- **`contributors`**: Mention your contributor ID if you have one.

For example, your YAML file could look like this:

```yaml
name: Super Podcast Bitcoin
host: Rogzy, JohnOnChain, Lounes, Fanis, Ajlex, Guillaume, Pantamis, Sosthene, Loic
language: en
links:
  podcast: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decouvrebitcoin-replay/id1693844092
  twitter: https://twitter.com/decouvrebitcoin
  website: https://decouvrebitcoin.fr

- In your podcast folder, click on the `Add file` button, then on `Create new file`:
![podcast](assets/19.webp)
- Name this new folder `assets` and confirm its creation by adding a slash `/` at the end:

![podcast](assets/21.webp)
