question:
  What is the probability of someone accidentally guessing your list of 12
  or 24 words in a Bitcoin wallet?
answer: Astronomically low
wrong_answers:
  - High
  - Moderate
  - Low
explanation: >-
  Thanks to the cryptography used to create the wallet, the probability
  of someone accidentally guessing your list of 12 or 24 words is astronomically low.
  It is like finding the "right" number between 1 and $2^256$, which is almost equivalent
  to finding the "right" atom in the Universe.
