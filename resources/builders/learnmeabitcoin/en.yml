  When I was 18 I started a poker strategy website. It was my first big project, but by the age of 23 I started to lose interest in poker. So I had a break from making websites for a while. At the start of 2015 I was 26, playing at bitcoin poker sites, and hadn't touched a HTML file in years. I needed a reason to get out of bed in the morning, so I decided to start making a website about my biggest interest at the time. I don't know what my skills are exactly, but I think one of them is explaining how things work in a way that is easy to understand. I also think that Bitcoin is currently the biggest possible challenge at this moment in time for explaining how something works, so here we go.
