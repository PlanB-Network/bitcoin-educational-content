term: ARBITRAGE
---

The practice of exploiting price differences of BTC (or any other asset) across different exchange platforms to make a profit. Arbitrage involves buying bitcoin on a platform where the price is relatively low and simultaneously selling it on another platform where the price is higher. Price discrepancies can occur due to differences in liquidity, demand, transaction volumes, and transfer times between exchange platforms. Arbitrage helps to balance prices across different platforms.
