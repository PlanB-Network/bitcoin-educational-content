term: BINARY PREFIXES
---

Units used in computing to quantify multiples of data sizes established on powers of 2. Unlike the prefixes of the metric system which use a base of 10, binary prefixes, such as kibi (Ki), mebi (Mi), gibi (Gi), and tebi (Ti), multiply by powers of 2 ($2^{10}$, $2^{20}$, $2^{30}$, $2^{40}$ respectively). These prefixes are inherited from the early ways of measuring information size on computers. They are sometimes found in Bitcoin, for example, to designate the file size limit of `BLOCKS/BLK*.DAT` files that are used to store the raw blockchain data in the Bitcoin Core software. These files have a maximum capacity of 128 mebibytes (MiB), which is equivalent to just over 134 megabytes (MB).
