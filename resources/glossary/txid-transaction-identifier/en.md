term: TXID (TRANSACTION IDENTIFIER)
---

A unique identifier associated with each Bitcoin transaction. It is generated by calculating the `SHA256d` hash of the transaction data. The TXID serves as a reference to find a specific transaction within the blockchain. It is also used to refer to a UTXO, which is essentially the concatenation of a previous transaction's TXID and the index of the designated output (also called "vout"). For post-SegWit transactions, the TXID no longer takes into account the transaction witness, which eliminates malleability.
