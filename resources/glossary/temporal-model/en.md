term: TEMPORAL MODEL

Certain human behaviors are recognizable on-chain. Perhaps the most useful in chain analysis is your sleep pattern! Yes, when you are sleeping, you presumably are not broadcasting Bitcoin transactions. Generally, you sleep around the same hours. Therefore, temporal analyses are commonly used in chain analysis. It simply involves recording the times at which a given entity's transactions are broadcast to the Bitcoin network. Analyzing these temporal patterns allows us to deduce numerous pieces of information.

Firstly, a temporal analysis can sometimes identify the nature of the traced entity. If we observe that transactions are broadcast consistently over 24 hours, then this may indicate significant economic activity. The entity behind these transactions is likely a business, potentially international and perhaps with automated procedures internally. Conversely, if we see that the temporal pattern is rather spread over 16 specific hours, then we might estimate that we are dealing with an individual user, or perhaps a local business depending on the volumes exchanged.

Beyond the nature of the observed entity, the temporal pattern can also approximately indicate the user's location through time zones. This allows us to correlate other transactions, and use the timestamp of these as an additional heuristic that can be included in a chain analysis.

In a different register, it is also this type of temporal analysis that led to the hypothesis that Satoshi Nakamoto was not operating from Japan, but indeed from the United States: [_The Time Zones of Satoshi Nakamoto_](https://medium.com/@insearchofsatoshi/the-time-zones-of-satoshi-nakamoto-aa40f035178f).
