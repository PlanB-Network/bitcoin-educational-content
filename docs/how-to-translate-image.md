# Introduction 

We are currently working on a complete image translation workflow to automate the process as much as possible.

At the moment, images can be translated manually by respecting the following rule: throughout all translations, mages should have the same name and be stored in the associated subfolder (eg. assets/fr/1.webp and assets/en/1.webp are the same file but translated in two different languages), this makes the replacement in the md file easier.
