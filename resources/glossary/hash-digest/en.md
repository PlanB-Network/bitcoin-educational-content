term: HASH DIGEST
---

In cryptography, refers to the result (or output) produced by applying a cryptographic hash function to a set of data. The hash digest is a fixed-size string of characters, usually represented in hexadecimal notation (base 16), consisting of a series of numbers and letters. This result is almost unique and specific to the input data, meaning that a minor change in the input will produce a completely different hash digest. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be one-way and collision-resistant, making it very difficult to retrieve the original data from the hash digest or to find two distinct inputs that produce the same hash digest.
