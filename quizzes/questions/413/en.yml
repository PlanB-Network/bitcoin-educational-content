question: What do the constants K represent in the SHA-256 function processing?
answer: The first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the cubic roots of the first 64
  prime numbers
wrong_answers:
  - The first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the square roots of the first 64 prime
    numbers
  - The first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the cubic roots of the first 8 prime
    numbers
  - The first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the square roots of the first 8 prime
    numbers
explanation: |
  In the SHA-256 function processing, the constants K, from 0 to 63, represent
  the first 32 bits of the decimal parts of the cubic roots of the first 64 prime
  numbers. These are used as basic ingredients in the cryptographic recipe.
