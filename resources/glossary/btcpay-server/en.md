BTCPay Server is an open-source payment processor that enables merchants and users to accept Bitcoin payments without relying on a third party for transaction processing. Launched in 2017, BTCPay Server provides a Bitcoin payment integration solution for e-commerce sites, with advanced features such as support for hardware wallets, billing and accounting tools, as well as compatibility with the Lightning Network. Its development was initiated by Nicolas Dorier, in response to the actions of Bitpay which, according to him, had misled its users by pushing them towards the adoption of SegWit2x, which the company mistakenly regarded as the "true" Bitcoin. This opposition was encapsulated in a now-famous tweet from Nicolas Dorier in August 2017:

> "_This is lies, my trust in you is broken, I will make you obsolete_".
