   The School of Bitcoin offers a dynamic learning community through V4V Open Lessons and the Decentralised Autonomous Education System (DAES).
   Our monthly V4V sessions on HiveTalk are open to all, fostering skill-sharing in the Bitcoin space, with participants able to receive direct donations. DAES supports aspiring learners by offering a platform for Bitcoin project submissions, potential funding, and mentorship.
   We also manage the Stacker News on Education territory and provide a Signal chat for collaboration. Join us to contribute, learn, and innovate within the Bitcoin community.
