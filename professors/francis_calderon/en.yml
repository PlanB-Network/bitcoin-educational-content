  I'm a software engineer, Open source & Bitcoin supporter. I spend my time contributing to open source Bitcoin and Ligthning Network related projects, I want to help make Bitcoin better money and be easy to use for non technical people. I've been working on Lightning Network projects since Q1 2018, currently I'm an independent consultant on Bitcoin/Lightning Network related projects, if you want to talk just DM me.
