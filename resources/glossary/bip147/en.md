term: BIP147

Proposal included in the SegWit soft fork aimed at resolving a malleability vector related to the dummy element consumed by the `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` and `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY` operations. Due to a historical off-by-one bug (unit shift error), these 2 opcodes remove an additional element from the stack beyond their basic function. To avoid an error, it is therefore mandatory to include a dummy value at the beginning of the `scriptSig` to satisfy the removal and bypass the bug. This value is unnecessary, but it must be there for the script to be valid. BIP11, which introduced the P2MS standard, advised putting an `OP_0` as the unnecessary value. However, this standard was not enforced at the consensus rules level, meaning any value could be placed there without invalidating the transaction. This is how `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` and `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY` contained a malleability vector. BIP147 introduces a new consensus rule, named `NULLDUMMY`, requiring that this dummy element be an empty byte array (`OP_0`). Any other value results in the immediate failure of the script evaluation. This change applies to pre-SegWit scripts as well as P2WSH scripts and required a soft fork.
