Acronym for "*Capped Pay Per Share with Recent Backpay*". It is a method for calculating the remuneration of miners within mining pools. In this system, the pool pays out as many shares as it can each time a block is found, prioritizing the most recent shares. This method ensures the financial stability of the mining pool, while offering task-based remuneration and encouraging miners to stay connected to the pool to avoid pool hopping.
