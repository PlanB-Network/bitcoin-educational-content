  "Debt; the first 5000 years" by David Graeber is an anthropological and historical analysis of the concept of debt throughout human civilization, from ancient Sumer to modern-day. The author challenges the commonly held belief that debt is a natural and necessary part of human society, and argues that it has been used as a tool for social control and domination. The book offers a thought-provoking perspective on the role of debt in our lives and its impact on social and economic systems.
