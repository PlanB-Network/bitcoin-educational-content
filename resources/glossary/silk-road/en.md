term: SILK ROAD
---

Silk Road was a dark web platform founded by Ross Ulbricht, also known under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts. Launched in 2011, this online marketplace allowed users to buy and sell products and services, both legal and illegal, while preserving their anonymity through the use of Tor and Bitcoin payments. Silk Road offered a wide range of items, mainly drugs and prescription medications, but excluded activities deemed contrary to natural law principles, such as the sale of hitman services or child pornography content.

The platform reflected Ross Ulbricht's agorist convictions, promoting a free and unregulated market, thereby escaping government control and taxation. Silk Road played a significant role in the initial adoption of Bitcoin in the early 2010s, contributing to its fame and use beyond cypherpunk circles.

Silk Road was shut down in 2013. Ross Ulbricht was arrested the same year and sentenced to two life sentences plus 40 years, without the possibility of parole, along with a fine of 183 million dollars. This sentencing raises questions about the proportionality of penalties for non-violent online crimes. Ross is still imprisoned today.
