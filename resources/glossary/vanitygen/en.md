term: VANITYGEN
---

The first open-source command-line software used to create custom receiving addresses (*vanity address*). It operates by generating and testing key pairs through trial and error until a receiving address that matches the user-specified criteria (such as a certain sequence of specific characters) is found. Vanitygen requires an intensive computational process, especially for long sequences.
