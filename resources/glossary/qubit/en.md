term: QUBIT
---

Basic unit of information on a quantum computer. These qubits can take the value of 0, the value of 1, or a superposition of 0 and 1. By using this superposition of states with other quantum phenomena such as entanglement and quantum interference, a quantum computer can parallelize computing processes, and thus solve certain specific problems much more quickly.
