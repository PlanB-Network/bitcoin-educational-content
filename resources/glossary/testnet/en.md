term: TESTNET
---

An alternative version of Bitcoin used exclusively for testing and development purposes. It is a network separate from the main network (mainnet), with its own blocks and transactions, allowing developers to test new features, applications, and updates without risking the main network. The testnet also enables the avoidance of transaction fees during testing. The bitcoins used on the testnet have no real value.
