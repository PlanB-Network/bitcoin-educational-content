term: BIG BLOCKERS
---

Name given to the supporters of increasing the block size during the Blocksize War between 2015 and 2017. Big blockers believe that it is necessary to increase this limit to allow Bitcoin to scale. They support proposals like Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited. They do not have a problem with implementing changes via hard forks, unlike small blockers who prefer soft forks.
