explanation: |
  The chapter explains that a price increase can be sector-specific and
  induced by various factors such as a decrease in OPEC production for oil or unfavorable
  weather conditions for wheat. Inflation, on the other hand, is defined by a generalized
  increase in prices across a range of goods and services, not just in a specific
  sector.
