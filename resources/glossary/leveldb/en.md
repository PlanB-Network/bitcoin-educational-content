A lightweight, fast, and open-source key-value storage library designed by Google. It is used in Bitcoin to store the UTXO set, the transaction index, and the block index. This database system was introduced in 2012 as part of the "Ultraprune" Pull Request aimed at replacing BerkeleyDB. This change had significant repercussions, including the creation of the first blockchain split with a major reorganization of 24 blocks on March 12, 2013. This incident was detailed in BIP50. Later, this system change even led to an unintentional hard fork on May 15, 2013.
