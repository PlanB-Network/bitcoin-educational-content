question: What is the principle of drawers in the context of cryptographic hash functions?
answer: It explains why, despite our best efforts, collision avoidance is impossible
  due to the limitation of output size.
wrong_answers:
  - It explains the storage mechanism of hash functions.
  - It describes the process of creating a hash.
  - It is a principle that explains the irreversibility of hash functions.

  The principle of drawers in the context of cryptographic hash functions
  explains that due to the limitation of output size, collision avoidance is impossible.
  This is because there are more possible inputs than outputs, so some inputs must
  inevitably share the same output.
