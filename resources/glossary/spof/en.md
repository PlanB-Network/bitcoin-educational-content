A Single Point of Failure (SPOF) in the field of computing refers to a component or an element of a system whose failure would result in the complete halt or a significant loss of functionality of the entire system. This could be a piece of hardware, a piece of information, software, or a part of a network. For example, in the specific context of HD Bitcoin wallets, the 12 or 24-word recovery phrase often acts as a SPOF for the wallet. If its secrecy is not maintained, the entirety of the wallet could be stolen. Similarly, its simple loss could lead to the loss of all the bitcoins in the wallet.
