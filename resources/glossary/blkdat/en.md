term: BLK*.DAT
---

Name of the files in Bitcoin Core that store the raw block data of the blockchain. Each file is identified by a unique number in its name. Thus, the blocks are recorded in chronological order, starting with the file blk00000.dat. When this file reaches its maximum capacity, the following blocks are recorded in blk00001.dat, then blk00002.dat, and so on. Each blk file has a maximum capacity of 128 mebibytes (MiB), which is equivalent to a little over 134 megabytes (MB). These files have been moved to the `/blocks` folder since version 0.8.0.
