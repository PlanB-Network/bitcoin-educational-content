  Deputy Minister of Economy Maurizio Leo announced an increase in the withholding tax on capital gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from 26% to 42%. The measure is part of the 2025 budget approved by the Council of Ministers and aims to recover resources to support interventions in favor of families, young people and businesses.
  The new measure represents a change compared to the legislation introduced with the 2023 tax year, which provided for a 26% tax rate for capital gains above 2,000 euros. The new rate of 42% will apply starting from the next tax year, modifying the tax regime of digital assets in Italy.
