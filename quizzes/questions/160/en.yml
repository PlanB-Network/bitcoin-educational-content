question: What is the significance of the energy cost in Bitcoin mining?
answer:
  The energy expenditure is necessary to produce the information, but the verification
  of information has a negligible cost. This asymmetry guarantees the security of
  the network.
wrong_answers:
  - The energy cost is necessary to power the ASIC machines used in mining.
  - The energy cost is necessary to maintain the Bitcoin network.
  - The energy cost is necessary to create new bitcoins.
explanation: >-
  The energy cost in Bitcoin mining is a crucial aspect of the network's
  security. The high energy cost of mining makes it extremely expensive for a malicious
  actor to manipulate the blockchain, while the low cost of verifying transactions
  ensures that anyone can participate in the network.
